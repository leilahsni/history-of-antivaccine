   The quarterback explained all - or at least, attempted to - in a
   remarkable interview with Pat McAfee on his SiriusXM sport talk show

   "anti-vax flat-earther", Rodgers went on to offer a bingo-card worth of
   anti-vaccine talking points, with a dash of conservative "cancel
   culture" critique thrown in.
