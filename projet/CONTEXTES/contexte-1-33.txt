   Words related to vaccines, including double-vaxxed, unvaxxed and
   anti-vaxxer, spiked in frequency in 2021

   Vax has been chosen as the word of the year by lexicographers at the
   Oxford English Dictionary (OED).

   Words related to vaccines have spiked in frequency in 2021 due to
   Covid, with double-vaxxed, unvaxxed and anti-vaxxer all seeing a surge
   in use.

   OED senior editor Fiona McPherson says vax was an obvious choice as it
--
     * vaxxie n. A photograph of oneself taken during or immediately
       before or after a vaccination, especially one against Covid-19, and
       typically shared on social media; a vaccination selfie
     * anti-vax adj. Opposed to vaccination
     * anti-vaxxer n. A person who is opposed to vaccination
