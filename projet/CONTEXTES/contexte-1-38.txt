   Dubious posts have been appearing on social media for a while and I'm
   wondering how best to approach the matter

   You never think it’s going to happen to you, do you? For months I’ve
   been reading about it and scoffing, but now it’s reached my family: we
   have an anti-vaxxer among us. Not just someone who’s a bit nervous
   about the jab, either. A proper, hardcore,
   you-lot-need-to-wake-the-hell-up crusader.

   conspiracies. A 60-something man recently wrote an anonymous newspaper
   article about his 30-year marriage being ripped apart by his wife doing
   the same, lost down a rabbit hole of lunatic theories. Last month, a
   Mumsnet post about one user’s anti-vax brother ran to nearly 400
   messages of others reporting family members who’d also become ensnared
   by these claims.
