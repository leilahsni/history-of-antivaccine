    Michael Chaves  left  posted a video after serving notices of liability 
    to Jeremy Vine 
     Telegram  Michael Chaves  

    Two weeks ago  an anti  vaxxer group led by Michael Chaves  a 
    55  year  old former paramedic from Kent  visited the home of BBC Radio 2 
    presenter Jeremy Vine  protesting against his reporting of Covid  19  

    The group served him a notice of liability for what they dubbed  crimes 
    against humanity  for his stance on vaccines  weeks after doing the 
    same at the home of TV  s Dr Hilary Jones  

    Just days ago  the same anti  vax mob descended on a hospital in 
    Colchester  where they tried to serve frontline health workers the same 
    notice before threatening them with a common law Nuremberg trial  

    The incidents this month were not unique  so  called sovereign citizens 
    have been using common law to intimidate and threaten those with power 
    for a while and their behaviour is escalating rapidly  an investigation 
    by public service journalism nonprofit The Citizenshas found  

    The common law system works on the basis that article 61 of Magna Carta 
    is still legally relevant  Originally written in 1215  article 61 
    states that a group of 25 men would be elected to keep  the peace and 
    liberties  granted by this charter  and says they can  claim 
    immediate redress  if any of the articles are broken

    Anti  vaxxers  serve  Colchester hospital 

    The article was removed from Magna Carta one year after it was written 
    – a fact which means little to the anti  vax groups now using it to 
    intimidate public figures by interpreting it as they see fit  

    In September  one such group walked into a courtroom at the Royal 
    Courts of Justice and approached the bench  Having attempted to serve 
    the judge with notice of his Covid  related  crimes   the group told 
    officials they were accountable for genocide and would be  going to the 
    gallows   

    Followers of the groups responsible often respond with death threats 
    and calls for violence on Telegram  

    The sovereign citizen ideology that is spreading among anti  vaxxer 
    communities in the UK is not new and has existed for some time in the 
    US – originating back in the 1970 s  

    Rachel Goldwasser  a research analyst for Southern Poverty Law Centre  
    has studied the American groups for seven years  She explained many 
    turn to both sovereign and QAnon rhetoric as a last  ditch attempt to 
    gain a sense of control over their lives  

    Jeremy Vine posted on Twitter threats made against him by anti  vaxxers 
    on Telegram 
     Jeremy Vine  Twitter  

    She said the US has seen escalating violence as a result of sovereign 
    citizens and warned that the situation in the UK will only get worse if 
    it goes unchecked  adding   It is only a matter of time before someone 
    snaps   

    She said  most often there is a level of desperation  which leads 
    people to the ideology as a last resort   Back in the Eighties and 
    Nineties in America it was financial desperation  There was a lot of 
    financial fear around foreclosure  and  in swoops a sovereign citizen  
    like a guru or group leader   

    She said they would tell prospective members  there is some sort of 
    magic cure  all   convincing people they were victims and  there is a 
    way to get back at the people who wronged them   

    Goldwasser said the ideology is now being fed to families who have had 
    children removed by social services   A sovereign will validate that 
    they are not the reason they lost their child to the state – that they 
    are the victim   she said   Some also offer court services to help 
     families  get their kids back  for a fee   This is not without risk 
    and  in one case  a self  titled  sovereign attorney  in Florida was 
    shot and killed after his pseudo  legal court challenge failed to return 
    a woman  s children  

    She said there is now a large number of Trump voters  stressed  that he 
    is no longer president  a situation which  combined with QAnon 
    conspiracies  has led many of them to become sovereign citizens  The 
    appeal of QAnon and sovereign citizenship  Goldwasser said  is the fact 
    that members  feel like they know the real truth that others don  t 
    know   

    Because of this  members build up confidence – something which has led 
    to several US sovereign citizens  pulling weapons on law enforcement   
    She said while most members in the UK have seemed relatively calm  she 
    has  zero doubt that the situation will get worse – it is only a matter 
    of time before someone snaps   

    For many in the UK  the primary sources of information are the Common 
    Law Court company and the UK Column – a niche West Country newspaper

    The Common Law Court is run via a website to which members can pay a 
    £ 50  per  month subscription to  reclaim  their  rights   By subscribing  
    members get an  identity card  declaring their sovereign status and the 
    ability to access a plethora of fake legal documents  The company is 
    also setting up its own cryptocurrency  

    UK Column began in Plymouth in 2006 as the Devonport Column  a 
    self  published newspaper with a readership of around 500 people  
    Convinced that the council was involved in an elaborate scheme to lie 
    to the people  editor Brian Gerrish – a retired navy lieutenant – made 
    it his mission to print the truth as he saw it  

    A devout Christian and author of several books on theology  Gerrish is 
    hyper  focused on the corruption of the legal system and the Bilderberg 
    Group  The gathering of global powers  which began at the Hotel de 
    Bilderberg in 1954 and has taken place every year since  was originally 
    intended to prevent another world war  According to Gerrish – and a 
    variety of conspiracy theorists – the group  s lack of transparency 
    points towards the creation of a New World Order and a global elite  

    Gerrish has participated in a number of protests against this supposed 
    elite and  in 2011  he joined the British Constitution Group as it 
    attempted to conduct a citizen  s arrest on a judge presiding over the 
    trial of a man who had failed to pay his council tax  

    Having spent years on the sidelines  including a failed run as an 
    independent candidate in local elections  Gerrish and UK Column owe 
    their current popularity to their willingness to jump on the anti  vax 
    train  In response to the vaccine rollout for 12  to 17  year  olds  the 
    paper  s website posted a live debate where it was suggested that 
    children may be at  significant risk from both vaccines and vaccinated 
    adults   There is no scientific evidence for this  but it fits within 
    their previous agenda of supposed child  safeguarding  

    Elements of both QAnon and common law are combined in various anti  vax 
    groups  who have convinced themselves the government is using the Covid 
    vaccine to harm children and that it is their job to prevent it  One 
    group   Magna Carta 61  led by Glaswegian beautician Janie Walsh  has 
    served notices to police accusing them of genocide and recently 
     seized  Edinburgh Castle  The aim was to return the castle to its 
     rightful owner  – an unemployed security guard who they believe is 
    King Arthur  

    The majority of Magna Carta 61 group members state that they are 
    self  employed or in low  paid positions – the demographic hit hardest by 
    lockdowns  

    Peter Knight  professor of American Studies at Manchester University 
    who has researched conspiracy theories  said they are difficult to 
    tackle because they are often  tied up with a person  s sense of 
    identity   

    To combat them  Professor Knight said governments  need to introduce 
    regulatory measures to force platforms to uphold the kind of standards 
    we expect from traditional media and other public fora   

    The comorbidity of sovereign citizen and QAnon ideologies peaks in 
    social media posts from Darral Pinch  who co  runs the Common Law Court  
    Pinch and his wife Laraine regularly post a variety of conspiracies on 
    Facebook  from 911 being faked by CGI to suggestions that random 
    phrases are clues to the Queen being replaced by a satanic cabal  

    In April 2020  Pinch celebrated the crowning of  King John III   an 
    Australian man who claimed he was the rightful heir to the British 
    throne  Six months later  the family of Joseph Gregory Hallett  as he 
    is actually known  were interviewed on YouTube and proved that he was 
    neither a descendent of royalty nor heir to the throne  

    The Common Law Court hastily recanted and suggested they had been 
    duped  but a video posted on Facebook this year showed other members of 
    the organisation and Magna Carta 61 group attending the swearing  in 
    ceremony for the man they claim to be King Arthur  

    Our investigation has revealed this man to be Gareth Barrett  a 
    41  year  old self  professed close protection specialist from Taunton  
    Barrett has previously claimed to be a member of the SAS and currently 
    owns a business named Kingsman Secret Service  

    Barrett has previously been pictured with Hallett and a photograph of 
    his swearing  in ceremony as  King Arthur  features a man who appears to 
    be a staff writer for UK Column  

    Since September  Barrett has issued a number of proclamations via the 
    Magna Carta Telegram group  advising followers to stop paying bills and 
    council tax – which many have now done – because he claims Donald Trump 
    has rendered UK statute law null and void  The reasoning behind this is 
    that Trump  supposedly  co  owns the Commonwealth with the so  called 
    King John III  

    When approached for comment  the Home Office said freedom to protest 
    within the law is a  fundamental part of democracy   

    But  added a spokesperson   The police must deal swiftly with the 
    selfish minority of protesters whose actions endanger the public  or 
    stop people going about their lives   

    Gareth Barrett  Brian Gerrish and UK Column were contacted for comment 
    but have not responded
