    Words related to vaccines  including double  vaxxed  unvaxxed and 
    anti  vaxxer  spiked in frequency in 2021 

    Vax has been chosen as the word of the year by lexicographers at the 
    Oxford English Dictionary  OED  

    Words related to vaccines have spiked in frequency in 2021 due to 
    Covid  with double  vaxxed  unvaxxed and anti  vaxxer all seeing a surge 
    in use  

    OED senior editor Fiona McPherson says vax was an obvious choice as it 
    has made  the most striking impact  

     It goes back at least to the 1980 s  but according to our corpus it was 
    rarely used until this year  she said  

     When you add to that its versatility in forming other words  vaxxie  
    vax  a  thon  vaxinista  it became clear that vax was the standout in 
    the crowd  

    Vax and vaxx are both accepted spellings but the form with one x is 
    more common  
    Presentational grey line 

    Oxford English Dictionary definitions for vax  
       vax n  A vaccine or vaccination 
       vax v  Treat  someone  with a vaccine to produce immunity against a 
        disease  vaccinate 
       vaxxie n  A photograph of oneself taken during or immediately 
        before or after a vaccination  especially one against Covid  19  and 
        typically shared on social media  a vaccination selfie 
       anti  vax adj  Opposed to vaccination

       double  vaxxed adj  Having received two doses of a vaccine

    Use of the word pandemic has also increased by more than 57000 this 
    year  

    Oxford Languages and Collins each decide their own word of the year  
    and in 2020 Collins chose  lockdown  

    But Oxford decided it was an unprecedented year with too many 
    contenders  so expanded its award to encompass a handful of newly key 
    words including lockdown  bushfires and Covid  19  as well as Black 
    Lives Matter  WFH  working from home  keyworkers and furlough  
    Previous words of the year    

    This year  s Oxford  winning word  vax  was first recorded in English in 
    1799  while its derivatives vaccinate and vaccination both first appear 
    in 1800  

    All of these words ultimately come from the Latin word vacca  which 
    means cow  According to the OED  this is due to English physician and 
    scientist Edward Jenner  s pioneering work on vaccination against 
    smallpox using cowpox  a mild infection that occurs in cows  in the 
    late 1790 s and early 1800 s  

    Oxford Languages says its corpus  or language resource  gathers news 
    content which is updated daily and contains over 145 billion words for 
    lexicographers to search and analyse
