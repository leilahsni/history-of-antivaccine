  Flourishing anti-vax movement threatens to derail immunisation campaigns in
                                     Africa

   The continent has traditionally been pro-vaccination but false claims -
   often pushed by prominent politicians - are gaining traction

   Fake news and conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines are
   flourishing in Africa as a second wave of infections hits the continent
   hard and immunisation campaigns struggle to take off.

   Fake news circulating on social media include claims that two children
   died in Guinea after being vaccinated against Covid-19; an Indian
   company supplied South Africa with an ineffective Covid-19 vaccine that
   was near its expiry date; and former US president Barack Obama warned
   Africans not to get vaccinated.

   Health officials across Africa are concerned this "infodemic" could
   further complicate lagging vaccine campaigns on a continent that has
   historically been pro-vaccines.

   "It is a huge concern and something that needs to be very strongly
   addressed so people understand the facts," Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the
   World Health Organization's director for Africa, told reporters earlier
   this month.

   "In general, people have been positive about their children getting
   vaccinated. It is only recently that anti-vaccine sentiment initiatives
   have started to land here."

   A global survey by the health charity Wellcome in 2019 showed that
   Africa had a greater trust in vaccines than any other continent, with
   nearly 90 per cent of respondents agreeing that vaccines are safe and
   effective.

   But confidence in Covid-19 vaccines, like in other parts of the world,
   has been much lower due to misinformation around the disease and
   concerns over the record pace of vaccine development.  And some of
   these false claims have been propagated by African leaders.

   Tanzanian president John Magufuli declared the country coronavirus-free
   last year and his government has gone against WHO advice and scientific
   consensus to reject mask-wearing and social distancing.  Mr Magufuli
   has also warned that Covid-19 vaccines could be harmful and has
   encouraged the use of unproven remedies such as steam inhalers and
   herbal medicine.

   "Vaccines are not good. If they were, then the white man would have
   brought vaccines for HIV/AIDS," Mr Magufuli said last month.

   However, he has since acknowledged that Tanzania is being hit by
   coronavirus after a high-profile politician died of the virus.

   Madagascan president, Andry Rajoelina, has also promoted an untested
   herbal remedy for Covid-19.

   However, many countries are charting a different course and are
   including information campaigns in their vaccination strategies, the
   WHO told the Telegraph.

   Health ministers in Malawi and Rwanda have stressed the importance of
   informing communities about vaccines as part of their upcoming
   immunisation campaigns.

   Rwanda's health minister said he would be happy to get the first shot
   to ease concerns, and Guinea's president Alpha Conde posted a recording
   of himself getting the jab. Ethiopia has already launched a vaccine
   information campaign.

   "Public awareness is important because there is so much negative
   propaganda especially on social media. It is very important for us to
   sensitise our people and to ensure people the vaccine is safe for
   them," said Malawi's health minister, Khumbize Kandondo Chiponda.

   To counter the infodemic, fact-checking groups have worked around the
   clock to disprove false claims. Journalists at organisations such as
   AfricaCheck and French news agency AFP, who have had fact-checking
   teams on the continent for years, have focused on coronavirus
   disinformation.

   They report debunking more than 1,000 misleading reports about the
   virus since the start of the pandemic, including anti-vaccine messages.

   Last month the African Alliance in South Africa filed a complaint
   against the country's top judge, Mogoeng Mogoeng, for claiming
   coronavirus vaccines were unsafe and the “work of the devil”.

   "The real danger is that statements such as Mogoeng's decrease the
   public trust in vaccines, and that hurts all of us," said African
   Alliance head Tian Johnson.

   "What public officials say matters. When what they say puts lives at
   risk and spreads dangerous lies about vaccines, we will hold them to
   account," they added.

   A year after the first case of coronavirus was reported in Africa, new,
   more contagious variants have fuelled a rapid rise in cases and sparked
   concern over the slow roll out of vaccines as richer nations stockpile
   doses. Cases have skyrocketed, particularly in southern Africa.

   It is too early to tell what impact these messages will have on
   vaccination campaigns, which have yet begun in most of sub-Saharan
   Africa.

   "The rhetoric around the safety of Covid-19 vaccines has done a lot of
   damage, we need to be honest on that," said Richard Mihigo, coordinator
   for the immunisation and vaccine development programme at WHO Africa.

   "It's a bit early to tell what will be the impact, however in a few
   countries that have started vaccination, the preliminary information we
   are getting is that people are lining up to get the vaccines which is a
   good surprise," he said.
