    Regulator Ofcom has announced Anna  Sophie Harling will be its online 
    safety principal  dealing with how the tech giants regulate harmful 
    speech  

    She will be in charge of implementing the Online Safety Bill  due to 
    come into effect later this year if approved by Parliament  

    Ofcom will be able to fine tech firms that fail to remove offending 
    content up to 10 of their global revenue  

    But one expert said this would require  bold leadership  

    Ms Harling will be part of a team reporting into Mark Bunting  director 
    of online policy  

  Really excited  

    Ms Harling is currently managing director for Europe at NewsGuard  
    which audits online publishers for accuracy  

     I  m really excited to be joining Ofcom  s online  safety team  she 
    said  

     Legislation will enable us to introduce meaningful transparency where 
    it has been lacking and empower Ofcom to hold platforms to account  

     I can  t wait to get started  

  Running rampant  

    Center for Countering Digital Hate  CCDH  chief executive Imran Ahmed 
    said Ofcom  s expanding role would  require bold leadership  with a 
    holistic vision of both the clear benefits and the undeniable harms of 
    those platforms  

    And Ms Harling should seek advice from the public as a first step in 
    her new job  

     In my experience  people don  t want racial hatred or dangerous 
    anti  vax propaganda running rampant on social  media platforms  he 
    said  

     Our polling shows people want far more assertive enforcement of their 
    right to good information than is currently available under the law
