   Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic
   this Sunday morning. We'll have another update for you on Monday.

1. Stop 'anti-vax' fake news, demands Labour

   Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines
   themselves. But now Labour is calling on the government to outlaw
   anti-vaccination "fake news" online. The party is demanding financial
   and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove
   anti-vaccine misinformation from their platforms.

2. Vaccine rumours debunked

   Meanwhile, our Reality Check team looked into some of the most widely
   shared false claims about vaccines: about alleged plots to put
   microchips into people, the supposed re-engineering of our genetic
   code, and about safety.

3. The Yorkshire cemetery struggling to keep up with burials

   Bradford's main Muslim cemetery has been struggling to keep up with
   burials as the second wave of the pandemic has gathered pace. It will
   take some medical detective work to determine the cause of this
   increase in deaths, says Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary,
   but multi-generational homes could be a factor.

4. Christmas cards 'even more poignant' this year

   With non-essential shops in England due to reopen from 2 December, will
   there be a rush to buy Christmas cards? Or will we keep in touch in
   other ways? Experts predict fewer cards will be sold this year - but
   the allure of handwriting will mean they retain their charm amid
   lockdowns

5. France's rural idyll threatened by Covid lockdown

   Bruniquel is one of France's most beautiful villages and about an hour
   north of Toulouse. Now, gone are the tourists and the streets are
   quiet, as the village, like the rest of France, endures a second Covid
   lockdown.
