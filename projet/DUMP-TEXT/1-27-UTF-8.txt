   Children aged between 12 and 15 will be offered vaccination by the end
   of term, Eluned Morgan says

   All 12 to 15-year-olds in Wales will be offered a Covid vaccine by the
   end of the October half-term, the Welsh health minister has said.

   The rollout is due to gather pace this week with all health boards
   providing jabs, mostly at mass vaccination centres and others in
   schools.

   Some of the most vulnerable children have already received the vaccine.

   Families have been encouraged to discuss the choice to help make an
   informed decision.

   Last month the UK's vaccine advisory body JCVI refused to give the
   green light to vaccinating healthy 12-15 year olds on health grounds
   alone.

   It said children were at such a low risk from the virus that jabs would
   offer only a marginal benefit.

   The UK's four chief medical officers then said healthy children aged 12
   to 15 should be offered one dose of a Covid vaccine as it would help
   reduce disruption to education.

   Health Minister Eluned Morgan said studies showed children were at some
   risk of developing long Covid despite low hospital admission rates.

   "Vaccines remain our strongest defence from the virus, helping prevent
   harm and stopping the spread of Covid-19," she said.

   "Some studies show one in seven children who have been infected with
   the virus are thought to have also developed long Covid.

   "We have provided resources and information to help this age group make
   an informed choice about vaccination. I encourage parents, guardians,
   children and young people to discuss the vaccination together," she
   said.

   Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines, said: "We
   have seen the benefits that come from having as many people as possible
   vaccinated.

   "After careful consideration of the evidence, the four UK chief medical
   officers recommended the vaccination of healthy 12 to 15-year-olds
   after consultation with experts, such as the Royal College of
   Paediatrics and Child Health.

   "They concluded that the health benefits, combined with the additional
   benefits of reducing educational disruption and effects on mental
   health meant that vaccination should be offered.

   "Children and their families will be receiving links to information
   with their invitation letters so they can make an informed decision
   about whether or not to have the vaccine," she said.

   Last month the chief medical officers agreed a single dose would help
   to reduce disruption to education.

   The recommendation that only one dose be given is related to the very
   rare risk of a condition called myocarditis, or inflammation of the
   heart muscle.

   The risk is tiny after one vaccine dose and slightly higher after two,
   with 12 to 34 cases seen for every one million second doses.

   Their decision came after the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and
   Immunisation said there was not enough benefit to warrant it on health
   grounds alone for most children.

'Direct threats' to head teachers

   Eithne Hughes, director of the Association for School and College
   Leaders Cymru, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers
   schools were already being targeted.

   "There have been anti-vax campaigners, who are very, very well
   coordinated, who have made direct threats to head teachers by phone, by
   letter - confettis of letter with quasi-legal challenges threatening
   court action and huge fines, fake NHS consent letters to try and trick
   schools into sending those out to parents with misinformation."

   She said it had caused a "real upset in the system".

   "Let's be really clear about this, the virus is the enemy, not Public
   Health Wales, not the school, and college leaders are doing their very
   best to educate learners and get everything back on track again," she
   said.

   "So it's deeply disappointing and if these people are listening, I
   would urge them to desist."

   Trefor Jones, head teacher at Ysgol Y Creuddyn in Penrhyn Bay, Conwy,
   said he had received letters from people opposed to children having a
   Covid vaccine.

   He said: "It is concerning... It does reference various legal processes
   they want to take, so yes, it is a challenge...

   "To be targeted in this way is a little disappointing."
