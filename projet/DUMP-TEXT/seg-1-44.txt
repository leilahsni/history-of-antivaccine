    Dr Fauci warns many Americans may refuse to take coronavirus vaccine 

    Social media platforms are making up to 1 bn a year from people 
    following anti  vaccine misinformation that could cause  tens of 
    thousands  of coronavirus deaths  researchers say  

    The Centre for Countering Digital Hate  CCDH  said the number of people 
    viewing pages and posts claiming that a Covid  19 vaccine is unnecessary 
    or would pose a health risk had risen dramatically during the pandemic  

    Despite pledges by Facebook and others to crack down on harmful posts  
    a report found that at least 57 million users now follow anti  vaxxers 
    on mainstream platforms across the UK and US – up 77 million since the 
    start of the outbreak  

    A YouGov poll suggested that almost one in five British adults say they 
    would refuse the injection if it becomes available  and a further 15 
    per cent are unsure  

    The research suggested that people who use social media more than 
    mainstream news outlets as a source of information are more likely to 
    reject a coronavirus vaccine

       Warning over coronavirus disinformation as extremists exploit 
        crisis 
       Covid  19 conspiracies must be taken seriously  warns extremism 
        chief 
       Inside the UK  s biggest anti  lockdown protest 
       Only one in 10 coronavirus misinformation posts taken down – report 
       The battle with coronavirus misinformation is only just starting 

     If 31 per cent of people do not take the vaccine we will not achieve 
    herd immunity   Imran Ahmed  chief executive of the CCDH  told The 
    Independent  

     If we don  t reach that we will not be able to contain the virus  We 
    will have waves and waves of years and years and tens of thousands of 
    people will die   

    Estimates of the proportion of people who must be immunised to 
    coronavirus  either by prior infection or vaccination  for herd 
    immunity to take effect vary between 55 per cent and 82 per cent  

    High vaccine coverage has largely eliminated many potentially fatal 
    diseases from the UK  but some – like measles – have seen a resurgence 
    when uptake has fallen  

    Studies have linked the trend to activism by online anti  vaxxers  who 
    oppose immunisation because they believe it is either unnecessary  
    risky or harmful  

    Mr Ahmed said social media firms had  both powered and profited from  
    the spread of anti  vax theories  by amplifying them through algorithms 
    and making money from advertising  

     It  s an ideological dirty bomb that will spread toxic misinformation 
    throughout a population   he added  

     If social media companies do not react in the right way  the 
    government needs to take action

    The report called for firms to be fined if they fail to combat 
    anti  vaxxers  but a new regulatory system proposed under the UK  s 
    Online Harms Bill has not yet been considered by parliament  

    The CCDH said that changing medical advice during the coronavirus 
    pandemic had provided the group an  opportunity to exploit  by seeking 
    to discredit official health bodies  

    Its analysis of more than 400 anti  vax Facebook groups and pages  
    YouTube channels and Twitter and Instagram accounts found that some 
    were selling fake cures for coronavirus and telling people not to seek 
    medical treatment for symptoms

       Almost half of Britons believe coronavirus is  man  made  poll 
        finds 

    Private Facebook groups were found to be  radicalising sceptics into 
    determined anti  vaxxers  by spreading emotional posts about supposedly 
    ill or cured children without challenge  

    The CCDH documented one case where a mother said she feared her 
    two  year  old daughter  with a fever and cough  had coronavirus but was 
    told by members to put lemon and onions on the child  s body rather than 
    going to a doctor  

    Other pages were selling substances they claimed would cure or prevent 
    coronavirus  including silver  hormones and plant extracts  

    Some anti  vaxxers have moved into wider conspiracy theories  including 
    those claiming that Microsoft founder Bill Gates created the pandemic  
    that vaccines cause Covid  19  and that tests for a coronavirus jab had 
    made women infertile  

    Mr Ahmed said that the coronavirus outbreak had created a  perfect 
    storm  for people to be drawn into anti  vax movements  as fear and 
    confusion combined with increased isolation and time spent online  

     There are some new groups springing up and there are more people 
    coming into those spaces   he added  

     We also know that existing groups are very opportunistic and will pick 
    up on any opportunity to draw people into their radical worldview

    The report found that both anti  vax campaigners and social media 
    companies were profiting from increased interest during coronavirus  

    It said that through all their online activity  the followers of 
    anti  vax accounts could be worth up to 1 bn  £ 800 m  in annual revenue 
    for technology giants  

    Researchers found that Facebook and Instagram get up to 989 m  £ 792 m  
    in revenue  Twitter 56 m  £ 45 m  and YouTube 797000  £ 634000  

    The report said that Facebook  s advertising library also showed that at 
    least 28 anti  vax accounts had paid to place adverts on the platform  
    despite the firm pledging in March 2019 that  when we find ads that 
    include misinformation about vaccinations  we will reject them   

    YouTube has removed advertising from some anti  vax channels but not 
    all  the report said  after it vowed to demonetise them in February 
    last year  

    Researchers found that Twitter  s advertising platform made it possible 
    to target users with anti  vaccine conspiracy theories  

    The report accused social media giants had adopted  lenient  policies 
    by making it harder to find anti  vax content rather than by removing 
    it  and allowing activists to  successfully navigate weak policies to 
    exploit the new opportunities coronavirus has presented   

    Mr Ahmed said that long  standing anti  vax campaigners had 
     instrumentalised  the prospect of a Covid  19 vaccine after trying to 
    claim that track and trace schemes were a cover for secretive 
    monitoring  
    The various coronavirus vaccines under development may ultimately not 
    include a successful candidate 
     Reuters  

     There are lots of decent  well  meaning people who fall for conspiracy 
    theories because they  re scared and confused  just as so many of us 
    are   he added  

     But I would go beyond calling anti  vaxxers conspiracy theorists to say 
    they are an extremist group that pose a national security risk   

    Mr Ahmed said the movement  transcended left and right  wing boundaries  
    but warned   Once someone has been exposed to one type of conspiracy 
    it  s easy to lead them down a path where they embrace more radical 
    world views that can lead to violent extremism   

    A Facebook spokesperson said   We are working to stop harmful 
    misinformation from spreading on our platforms and have removed 
    hundreds of thousands of pieces of Covid  19  related misinformation  

     We reduce vaccine misinformation in News Feed  we don  t show it in 
    search results or recommend it on Facebook or Instagram  we don  t allow 
    it in ads  and we connect people with authoritative information from 
    recognised health experts   

    A spokesperson for Twitter said anyone searching for vaccine  related 
    information is directed to the NHS and its advertising policy forbade 
    misleading medical claims  

    It added   Twitter  s top priority is protecting the health of the 
    public conversation and surfacing authoritative public health 
    information   

    YouTube said all six channels featured in the report had now been 
    demonetised  

     We  ve taken a number of steps to address misinformation including 
    surfacing more authoritative content across our site for people 
    searching for vaccination  related topics  beginning to reduce 
    recommendations of certain anti  vaccination videos and showing 
    information panels with more sources where they can fact check 
    information for themselves  a statement added  

    A government spokesperson said   Since the start of the pandemic  
    specialist government units have been working at pace to identify and 
    rebut false information about coronavirus  We are also working closely 
    with social media platforms to help them remove incorrect claims about 
    the virus that could endanger people  s health  

     We are developing our world  leading plans to put a duty of care on 
    online platforms towards their users and will introduce legislation as 
    soon as possible
