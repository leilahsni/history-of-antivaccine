   Emergency laws to "stamp out dangerous" anti-vaccine content online
   should be introduced, Labour has said.

   The party is calling for financial and criminal penalties for social
   media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines.

   It follows news of progress on the first effective coronavirus vaccine.

   The government said it took the issue "extremely seriously" with "a
   major commitment" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle
   anti-vaccine content.

   Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or
   disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service.

   But Labour said a commitment by platforms to remove content flagged by
   the government was not enough.

   Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was
   "exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and
   governments and spreading poison and harm".

   He told BBC Breakfast his party wanted to work with the government on a
   cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the
   vaccine.

   He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine
   means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was
   appropriate for those with chronic health conditions.

   "There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public
   health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay
   those fears," he said.

   Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been
   spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news
   rekindled these pre-existing narratives online.

   These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting
   microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon
   of genocide.

   Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine,
   comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping
   up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram.

   This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns
   that a vaccine is safe and properly tested.

   Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and
   the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to
   have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine.

   The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only
   thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online.

   Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread
   other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the
   pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines.

   There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that
   hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for
   weeks and impacting those who come across them.

   Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group,
   Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of "flip-flopping" between
   encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown
   restrictions in England.

   Professor John Edmunds said: "We need to take a long-term view and be
   sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in
   place for some time.

   "Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily
   when large numbers of people have been vaccinated.

   "But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is
   what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars,
   versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way
   to run the epidemic."

   The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December,
   with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions.

   Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher
   restrictions, saying it was not "very well thought through".

   Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions.
   Wales has now ended a "circuit breaker" while Northern Ireland has
   extended its own temporary lockdown.

   A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462
   more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported.

Spreading false claims

   Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines
   themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or "anti-vax"-
   movement has gained traction online.

   Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about
   vaccines to spread more easily.

   In 2019, the UK lost its measles-free status designated by the World
   Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in
   vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children.

   Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus
   to the coronavirus.

   In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there
   were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of
   thousands of followers who were "churning out disinformation" on the
   issue.

   Last week, the government announced that social media companies had
   agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be
   profiting from Covid vaccine fake news.

   But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has
   questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down.

   "The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was
   welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove
   only the content which is flagged by government and which generates
   profit," Labour said.

   Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and
   criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would
   vote for it.

   On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary
   results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent
   more than 90% of people from catching Covid.

   The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final
   stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for
   emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a
   limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year.

   The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people.

   But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final
   safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and
   Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

   The head of the MHRA said this week it will not lower its safety
   standards despite the need to get a Covid vaccine quickly.

   vaccine."

   Earlier this year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called people who
   oppose vaccinations "nuts".

   And this week, he said he had "no inhibitions" about getting one,
   adding: "Anti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a
   vaccine."

   A government spokesperson said: "Letting vaccine disinformation spread
   unchecked could cost British lives.

   "We take this issue extremely seriously and have secured a major
   commitment from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle it by not
   profiting from such material, and by responding to flagged content more
   swiftly.

   "We continue to work closely with social media firms to promote
   authoritative sources of information so people have access to vaccine
   facts not fiction."
