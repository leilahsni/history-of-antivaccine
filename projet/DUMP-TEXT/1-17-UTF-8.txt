   In a policy shift, Facebook is now removing groups and pages that
   discourage people from getting vaccines. As social media giants grapple
   with the anti-vaccine movement, Specialist disinformation reporter
   Marianna Spring meets the everyday citizens battling conspiracy
   theories in their spare time.

   The banner image shows a Photoshopped picture of Bill Gates with a
   crazed expression holding a needle decorated with a skull and
   crossbones. It looks like a Facebook group promoting anti-vaccine
   conspiracy theories.

   But this group actually has very different intentions.

   Richard is a builder, a trainee psychologist - and one half of the duo
   behind the decoy group. He says he aims not to spread bad information
   but rather to help people attracted to conspiracy theories.

   His friend Dave (not his real name; we've agreed to give him a
   pseudonym because he fears abuse from anti-vaccine activists) believed
   in conspiracy theories for the best part of 20 years.

   "If I was to actually create a group saying, 'I'm going to re-educate
   you'... then I'm not going to get any takers," he says.

   "So I have to do it in a stealth way, which is a bit underhanded, I
   suppose. But the intentions are good."

   The group's name references Bill Gates and completely unfounded
   conspiracy theories that the Microsoft founder is plotting to kill
   millions of people and control them with implanted microchips. And once
   people are drawn in, the two moderators try to reason with them, to
   bring them back to reality.

   Richard and Dave are just two of the dozens of volunteers the BBC has
   spoken to who are combating online misinformation about vaccines. But
   are they doing work that should be Facebook's responsibility?

The problem

   Original research from BBC Monitoring has revealed how Facebook pages
   and groups promoting misleading and false claims about vaccines saw a
   significant rise in followers in several countries across the globe in
   the past year.

   In Ukraine, pages sharing anti-vaccine content grew by 157% in 2020,
   reaching nearly 26,000 page likes, double the rate for the previous
   year. In Mexico, Brazil and India, similar pages grew by around 50%
   each in the past year - faster than in the two previous years.

   It's further proof of the spread of anti-vaccine content throughout the
   pandemic.

   Previous research found a huge spike in followers of English-language
   social media accounts promoting anti-vaccine material during the
   pandemic, especially on Instagram and Facebook.

   Although there is some overlap online, our research focused on extreme
   content - accounts and groups spreading false "genocide" and "implanted
   microchip" claims - rather than legitimate questions people have about
   safety and efficacy, and stories about rare cases of blood clots.

Volunteers fight back

   It was the pandemic's wave of anti-vaccine content that prompted Dave
   and Richard to embark on their plan.

   "I was out of work," Dave says. "So I wanted to do something
   constructive."

   Although the duo have only met in real life once, they now run multiple
   "honeypot" Facebook groups that have thousands of members from all over
   the world.

   Inside the groups, people who believe in vaccine and Covid-19
   conspiracy theories are allowed by the moderators to post false and
   misleading articles.

   Richard admits he's conflicted about the deception.

   "It was horrible having to lie to begin with," he says.

   After members initially joined the group, he says, the pair would
   observe what they shared, sometimes for weeks.

   "And then it'd stop," Richard says, "and we'd start questioning their
   narrative."

   Dave and Richard debunk myths and challenge people in comments under
   posts and via private message.

   decoy anti-vaccine Facebook groups.

   Dave uses his own personal experience of conspiracy theories to strike
   up a rapport with those in the group. He began to question his previous
   worldviews after he realised that the people promoting conspiracies
   were conning him. Their nightmare scenarios, he says, never seemed to
   come true.

   "I just got tired of it," he says, "I got tired of finding out about
   the next conspiracy, the next conspiracy and then looking back and
   thinking, well, this didn't happen and that didn't happen."

   in London and other cities

   Richard says some of his friends and family have been affected by
   online misinformation. He tries to engage with members of the groups to
   understand how they have fallen for falsehoods.

'I might not be here'

   One of those people was Brian. He was scared off vaccines by misleading
   posts on social media sites - including graphic videos promoting false
   claims about foetuses being used in jabs.

   Brian's encounters with the underbelly of social media coincided with
   an incredibly difficult personal time. Towards the end of 2019, he lost
   his job. He has multiple sclerosis, and around the same time, his
   condition started getting worse. Then the pandemic hit.

   "I wasn't in a good place," he says, sitting on his leather sofa at
   home. He explains how he spent hours watching YouTube videos made by
   anti-vaccine activists.

   But he also joined Dave and Richard's Facebook group, thinking it was
   an anti-vaccine community. And that's when things started to change.

   "They sort of swung me round," Brian says, "by sending me actual
   factual information."

   Richard talked with him about the personal difficulties that had left
   him vulnerable to the easy explanations of online pseudoscience. And he
   also explained how the algorithms of social media sites work to reel
   people in - with emotion, and by serving up content similar to that
   which the user has seen before.

   Brian even credits Dave and Richard with saving his life. If he hadn't
   encountered their group, Brian says, "I might not be here. I went to
   some dark places."

   But now, he says, things are looking up.

   "I'm in a better place," he says. "I'm in a proper home environment
   now, I've got rugrats running around my feet again." His face lights up
   as he speaks of his grandchildren.

   He's also had a vaccine against Covid-19, having been completely
   opposed to it just a few months before.

'Vaccine discouragement'

   Richard blames social media sites - particularly Facebook - for failing
   to protect users like Brian.

   "It needs to be policed a lot better," he says. "And until they do,
   conspiracies are going to keep growing."

   In an interview, Facebook's vice president for Northern Europe Steve
   Hatch acknowledged that the company has "a big responsibility to ensure
   people are seeing accurate information."

   Mr Hatch told the BBC that the company is now removing groups, pages
   and accounts that deliberately discourage people from taking vaccines,
   regardless of whether the information can be verified as false or not.

   It's a shift in policy. Previously Facebook would only delete groups -
   and accounts on Instagram, which it owns - filled with outright false
   vaccine information. Some of the groups that fall under the new policy
   may include material that's true, or unverifiable, but are not outright
   falsehoods.

   protest in London

   This includes Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members that
   have sprung up in recent months, dedicated to stories of people
   allegedly injured by Covid vaccines. We've seen several of these groups
   rapidly become popular. They're often filled with scary stories, but
   just as frequently lacking in details and hard evidence.

   Facebook say they've been combating misinformation, that they've
   labelled more than 160 million pieces of misleading content since the
   start of the pandemic, and connected 2 billion people to information
   from trusted health authorities.

Policy dilemmas

   Meanwhile, Richard and Dave's honeypot group has been suspended -
   because while they say their intentions are good, the group does
   contain posts pushing falsehoods.

   It's a situation that highlights the moderation challenges faced by
   Facebook - where a group like this, which they say is dedicated to
   helping individuals, technically breaches the company's rules.

   Richard and Dave are appealing the decision. And they plan to keep
   using their methods to help people like Brian -and others like him, who
   they are yet to reach.
