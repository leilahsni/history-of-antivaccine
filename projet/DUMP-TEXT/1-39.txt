  Andrew Wakefield uses coronavirus pandemic to push discredited anti-vaccine
                                     claims

   The disgraced British former doctor has been appearing at summits
   during the pandemic to claim vaccines 'will kill us'

   Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced British former doctor, is using the
   coronavirus pandemic to promote his claims that vaccines are unsafe as
   he calls for widespread protests against their use in America.

   Since being struck off the British medical register over a discredited
   study suggesting a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism, Mr
   Wakefield has become a prominent figure within America’s anti-vaccine
   movement.

   Now, with the outbreak of Covid-19 in the US, Mr Wakefield has been
   appearing alongside other prominent vaccine sceptics who promote
   unfounded theories that call into doubt the severity of the virus and
   suggest its dangers have been exaggerated in order to force the public
   to receive mandatory vaccinations.

   In one recent appearance, Mr Wakefield called on his followers to
   protest “in numbers that are sufficient to terrify the politicians into
   doing the right thing”. He went on to warn of a scenario in which
   vaccines will cause “one in two children” to have autism by 2032.

   “Vaccines are going to kill us,” he added, “people need to wake up to
   that”.

   Offering a dystopian view of the future, he said: “Everything [else] is
   irrelevant... that's what we face, it's so enormous that people can't
   even conceptualise where we are.”

   The comments were made during a nine-part documentary series entitled
   "The Truth About Vaccines", in which Mr Wakefield is identified as a
   gastroenterologist and a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. The
   Royal College of Surgeons confirmed to The Telegraph that Mr Wakefield
   has not been a member of the body since 1996.

   Another prominent anti-vaccine activist and close friend of Mr
   Wakefield, Del Bigtree, also appears in the series to claim the latest
   vaccine discussion is an attempt "by the pharmaceutical industry to
   take over our lives once and for all".

   There is no evidence that vaccines are unsafe, and most health
   officials agree that a safe and effective treatment is the only long
   term route out of the current pandemic.

   Wakefield is tapping in to anti-lockdown sentiment

   But Mr Wakefield and his peers have found a newly receptive audience
   among Americans who are frustrated with the ongoing restrictions in
   place to halt the spread of Covid-19.

   In recent weeks thousands of protesters across the US have defied
   lockdown orders to voice their frustration at the restrictions, arguing
   they constitute government overreach.

   They have been joined by anti-vaccine activists who argue the lockdowns
   are evidence of the kind of government intervention into individuals’
   health care that they have long warned against.

   “The anti-vax movement has aligned itself very nicely with that open-up
   movement which is all anti-government, pro-autonomy,” said Dr Litjen
   Tan, from the Immunization Action Coalition.

   “I think [Wakefield] is galvanising that to stoke fear,” he said.

   Vaccine proponents are also warning that these fears about the jabs are
   being promoted at a time when immunisation rates are already falling
   because most people are avoiding non-essential medical appointments.

   One activist, Ethan Lindenberger, a teenager who made headlines last
   year when he defied his mother’s wishes to get vaccinated, said he had
   noticed a definite increase in vaccine-related misinformation and
   conspiracy theories in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

   He said the misinformation ranges from claims that face masks pose
   serious health risks to theories that Covid-19 is linked to 5G towers.

   “If you look at statistics from polls and discussions with people as
   the quarantines and shutdowns continue, there has been a really large
   rise in impatience and anger towards the medical community,” he said.

   "That lends itself into a larger distrust towards the government and
   that's what the anti-vaccine community feeds on.”

   “You’ve seen the anti-vaccine community targeting that by saying ‘you
   don’t want to be stuck at home, you don’t want the government to tell
   you what to do. They shut down the economy, lost your job and once they
   have a vaccine they’re going to pump it into your kids'. That ideology
   rings true to a lot of people in a very dangerous way.”
