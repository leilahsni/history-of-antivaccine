Rising number of anti-vaxxers ‘willing to take direct action against schools’

   “Substantial numbers” of people influenced by conspiracy theories are
   now willing to take direct action against schools administering
   vaccines, experts on online misinformation have warned, as Labour
   called for exclusion orders to block activists.

   Amid findings that close to 80% of schools had been targeted by
   anti-vaxxers, Keir Starmer said it was “sickening” that those against
   vaccinations were demonstrating where children are educated.

   The home secretary, Priti Patel, called such protests “completely
   unacceptable”, adding that children, teachers or parents should not be
   “intimidated and harassed outside their schools”.

   Her comments in the Daily Telegraph were echoed by the education
   secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, who said the “disgraceful actions of a small
   minority … must be brought to an end”.

   A warning was also issued by the Center for Countering Digital Hate
   that exclusion zones in themselves would not be enough to counter what
   it described as a “novel extremism threat”.

   “What measures are the government taking to look into the networks
   encouraging people, and the individuals encouraging people to take this
   sort of action?” said founding CEO Imran Ahmed. “Most people will have
   swallowed some kind of misinformation, many people will have swallowed
   a bit of conspiracy theory … very, very few people then go on to
   actually take real live action.

   “We now have substantial numbers of people who are willing to take
   direct action against schools to disrupt their activities because they
   believe them to be trying to harm children by administering a vaccine.”

   Exclusion zones were needed, he said, but also warned of the broader
   problem, which was being driven by the dynamics of social media
   organising groups where more extreme comments were being amplified and
   rewarded.

   The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) revealed this
   month that most of the schools surveyed by the union (79%) had been
   targeted by anti-vaxxers. This had mainly been through emails
   threatening legal action, but the ASCL said in some cases staff had
   been threatened with physical harm and that some protesters had gained
   access to school sites.

   Starmer said: “It is sickening that anti-vax protesters are spreading
   dangerous misinformation to children in protests outside schools. The
   uptake of vaccines among children is far too low and the government’s
   rollout is painfully slow. Everything must be done to get those
   eligible jabbed as quickly as possible in this public health emergency.

   “Labour believes the law around public spaces protection orders [PSPOs]
   urgently needs to be updated so that local authorities can rapidly
   create exclusion zones for anti-vax protests outside schools.”

   PSPOs can be used to disperse people from a public area and have
   previously been used to move on protesters outside abortion clinics or
   to allow police to confiscate alcohol in certain spaces.

   But gaining permission to impose one takes significant consultation,
   and Labour is calling for an expedited process in cases of preventing
   harassment and intimidation of children outside schools if agreed by
   the school, the leader of the local council and the local police chief
   constable.

   The party said the PSPO could be in place within five days and for up
   to six months.

   Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the ASCL, said: “We would
   welcome any action which helps to keep anti-vaccination campaigners
   away from schools and which allows pupils and staff to go about their
   business without this intrusion.

   “Schools are operating under great pressure because of the disruption
   which continues to be caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The last
   thing they need is the additional problem of protesters outside their
   gates.”

   He added that jabs were key to keeping pupils in the classroom, and
   said: “If protesters think otherwise, there are plenty of outlets for
   them to express their views without resorting to targeting schools.”

   The ASCL previously said that of the 526 responses from schools
   eligible for the Covid vaccination programme for 12-15-year-olds, 13%
   had reported seeing protesters immediately outside their school and 20%
   had reported protesters in the local area.

   Eighteen schools said protesters had gained access to and protested
   inside the premises, while 20 said they had received communications
   threatening physical harm to staff.
