                  Yikes! We have an anti-vaxxer in the family

   Dubious posts have been appearing on social media for a while and I'm
   wondering how best to approach the matter

   By Sophia Money-Coutts 19 September 2021 • 6:00am

   It's hard to argue with an anti-vaxxer in the family who believes
   they’re on the ‘right’ side (BUTTON)

   It's hard to argue with an anti-vaxxer in the family who believes
   they’re on the ‘right’ side, says Sophia

   You never think it’s going to happen to you, do you? For months I’ve
   been reading about it and scoffing, but now it’s reached my family: we
   have an anti-vaxxer among us. Not just someone who’s a bit nervous
   about the jab, either. A proper, hardcore,
   you-lot-need-to-wake-the-hell-up crusader.

   Dubious posts had been appearing on her social media for a while. But
   last weekend, while various of us were staying at my sister’s house in
   Kent, the family member in question forwarded a link with the message
   “Can I leave you to get it out to as many people as possible please?” I
   clicked on the link, which led to 18 videos totalling almost eight
   hours of “evidence” that Covid is a hoax. I clicked on a few videos
   and, long story short, they were offering the sort of conspiracy
   messages that you see scrawled on the back of the loo door in the pub.
   “Masks are a key component of the cabal’s agenda”, Bill Gates is an
   evil lizard and so on.

   We laughed over lunch. My brother replied simply saying “Still angry
   then?” My stepmother asked her to stop sending nonsense. My sister
   replied saying “Please don’t send me this stuff!” although later
   realised she’d misspelt “don’t” and actually typed “dot”.

   The next day, we were sent another link to a story that claimed the
   Australian authorities were gassing those in quarantine, and the
   situation escalated. This is a family newspaper so I can’t relate the
   language used but suffice to say my brother, who fought back, was
   accused of being part of the male liberal elite and told that he
   personified “all the world’s evils”.

   We stopped laughing then because it was less funny. More troubling and
   sad. Plenty of other families are facing similar. One friend says her
   mother sits in front of the computer all day reading virus
   conspiracies. A 60-something man recently wrote an anonymous newspaper
   article about his 30-year marriage being ripped apart by his wife doing
   the same, lost down a rabbit hole of lunatic theories. Last month, a
   Mumsnet post about one user’s anti-vax brother ran to nearly 400
   messages of others reporting family members who’d also become ensnared
   by these claims.

   What to do? Do you avoid the topic, or try and gently discuss it? Do
   you crack jokes about being 5G activated? According to one Mumsnet
   poster, the only solution is to change the subject. “What they’re doing
   this weekend (good). Bill Gates is trying to kill us all (ignore).”
   It’s difficult when you’re under bombardment, though. When my
   stepmother tried to remonstrate again, she was patronised and asked why
   she was too scared to watch a few videos. Trying to argue with this
   sort of defence is like wrestling in Fairy Liquid.

   I understand completely that some people are vaccine hesitant and have
   wholly legitimate concerns, but there’s a vast difference between
   hesitation and forwarding on dodgy links to friends and family in the
   belief that you’re on the right side of “the most dangerous war ever
   waged”. That’s according to the bearded, middle-aged man who made those
   18 videos, although having sat through various of his homilies, I
   wouldn’t trust him to babysit my pot plants. Oh, for the halcyon days
   when all we fought about was the Northern Irish backstop.

Sex scene shy? I just have a strong coffee and get on with it

   Sex scenes are a nightmare for writers, but sex itself can also be
   awkward and at times cringe-inducing

   Sally Rooney nearly cut the sex scenes from her new book because she
   found them a turn-off. As one who feels the same whenever, er,
   limbering up to write a racy bit, I sympathise. Whenever I begin, I
   mostly want to gouge my own eyes out and sit at my desk hooting with
   embarrassment. Can I use that word? Surely I can’t use that word? Sex
   scenes are a nightmare and I suspect they make all writers cringe and
   snigger. But then sex itself occasionally makes one cringe and snigger
   so at least we’re reflecting real life. The only way forward, Sally, is
   to embrace them with gusto. I have an extra strong coffee, a bigger
   breakfast than usual and set to. Also, count yourself lucky you don’t
   narrate your audio books, because reading one’s sex scenes aloud is
   much more embarrassing than writing them.

Watching Strictly is murder on the dance floor

   A post shared by BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly)

   I have a confession to make: I loathe Strictly Come Dancing, the 626th
   series of which began last night. Greg Wise! That one off EastEnders!
   Gordon Ramsay’s daughter! I know, I know, millions of families up and
   down the country take great joy in settling down on the sofa for nine
   hours every Saturday and Sunday night. But why? The dances all look
   exactly the same; the judges’ gags are pantomime-awful, and don’t get
   me started on the “theme” weeks. It drags on so long, too, all the way
   to Christmas. A friend who went to watch in the audience once also told
   me she had to sit for so long without a loo break she almost wet
   herself, which I’m afraid was the final nail in its sparkly coffin.
   Give me the gladiatorial rawness and testicle-eating challenges of I’m
   a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! (starts in November) any day.
