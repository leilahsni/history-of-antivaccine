    Scientists advising the government during the coronavirus pandemic have 
    been sent suspicious packages from people who feel they are  making bad 
    decisions  

    Prof Calum Semple said he had been on the receiving end of a 
     particularly nasty  experience  

    He has regularly appeared on television and radio to be quizzed on the 
    virus  

    The University of Liverpool professor told how scientists and others 
    had  attracted adverse attention  

    During a webinar hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine  Prof Semple  
    who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies  Sage  was 
    asked about being targeted by an anti  vax group  

    Prof Roger Kirby  president of the society and host of the session  
    asked about an incident in which somebody post something extremely 
    abusive online  

  Nasty event  

    Prof Semple said that was correct and added   That was one particularly 
    nasty event  

     There have been others since then and suspicious packages sent to Sage 
    members and myself  

     This comes from both extremes  people that feel that we  re making bad 
    decisions and they don  t appreciate that Sage is not a decision  making 
    body  

    He stressed that scientists advising the government were there to 
    answer  exam questions from ministers or from chief scientific officers 
    or chief medical officers  and to give their best estimates  

    A spokesman for the Government Office for Science said security issues 
    were taken seriously and Sage members would be offered  security advice 
    and support  so they can continue to provide independent expert advice  

    In July  a former estate agent was given a suspended sentence when he 
    admitted a charge of assault by beating after England  s chief medical 
    officer was put in a headlock in a London park  

    Prof Chris Whitty has also been forced to endure public harassment on 
    previous occasions  having been confronted in a street in Oxford by a 
    man accusing him of lying to the public about coronavirus and accosted 
    outside Westminster
