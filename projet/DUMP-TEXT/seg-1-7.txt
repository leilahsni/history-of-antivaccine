    A noisy minority in NSW  s northern rivers are pushing back against 
    Covid  19 restrictions

    Benny Zable has lived in Nimbin on and off since 1973  when he arrived 
    in town for the Aquarius festival – the event that seeded 
    counterculture and escapist lifestyles into the northern rivers of New 
    South Wales  

    The 75  year  old artist and activist is a storied figure in this part of 
    Australia  now a heartland for alternative health and wellness 
    advocates  and notorious for low immunisation rates  He was also the 
    first person from Nimbin to show up for a Covid  19 vaccine  

     I  ve had people – they were just nasty  really nasty  getting stuck 
    into me   Zable says   There  s all kinds of alternative people  a lot 
    of them through their life history they don  t trust the system  me 
    included

     A lot of people don  t trust any of it  A lot of people have been 
    disillusioned with the government  My friends who are getting stuck 
    into me because I got the vax  you can have to  and  fro about it that 
    gets nowhere  they  re so entrenched with it  

     I  m not 100 on these vaccines either  But the thing is the nurses and 
    doctors they give you the information  you read through it  What they 
    give you is not going to give you a disease  So you  ve got to trust 
    that and think about future generations   

    Child vaccination rates in the northern rivers are Australia  s lowest  
    In the Byron shire  682 of one  year  olds are fully immunised  
    compared with 949 across the country

    In the hinterland town of Mullumbimby  locals say they have been banned 
    from cafes for raising concerns that staff are not wearing masks  
    Businesses have placed signs in shopfront windows asking vaccinated 
    customers not to enter under the misapprehension they could shed the 
    virus  

     The pandemic was always going to come to the northern rivers   says 
    Mark Swivel  who runs a community legal clinic in Mullumbimby  

    Last week Covid arrived in the guise of a real estate speculator from 
    Sydney  The man and his teenage son have since been charged with 
    breaching NSW public health orders  

 Out with authority 

    Swivel says compliance with restrictions in the region has  actually 
    been quite high  and that pushback has abated significantly

     I think the problems here are real but overstated   he says   There  s 
    a noisy minority who adamantly oppose vaccinations and Covid 
    restrictions  There  s a significant spectrum of opinion from legitimate 
    hesitancy right through to paranoid dystopian delusion   

    He believes this opposition to rules and vaccines is  an expression of 
    fear  primarily   

      There  s a significant spectrum of opinion from legitimate hesitancy 
      right through to paranoid dystopian delusion  

    Mark Swivel 

     There  s a huge sense of threat among a lot of people who have chosen 
    certain alternative lifestyles   he says   Everyone up here is 
    anti  authoritarian  

     There  s a fat streak of nonconformism across the community  whether 
    you  re poor  rich  or whatever you believe  What you see in anti  Covid 
    actions is a particular strain – image intended – of that strong theme  

     The fear that  s being expressed by many opponents of vaccines and 
    Covid restrictions comes from a sense of encroachment on the refuge of 
    the paradise of the northern rivers   
    Byron Bay and Tamworth in lockdown amid 283 new Covid cases in NSW 
    Read more 

    That encroachment has been writ large for years as Byron Bay and its 
    surrounds have become a playground for celebrities and rich tree 
    changers  The median house price in Mullumbimby has just increased 
    beyond 1 m  

     It is a very wealthy town now   Swivel says  

    Liz Elliott  a former emergency department doctor in Mullum  says a 
     strong element  of the community – she estimates between 40 and 50 – 
    are  suspicious of the whole orthodox response  to Covid  She  s one of 
    them  

     It  s not so much that we  re suspicious of authority  it  s that 
    authority has shown itself to be unable to deal with the challenges of 
    this century over and over again   Elliott says  

     People always point at dissenters as if we are the problem  The 
    problem is we  re not looking at the long term of our society  Covid has 
    been used as an enormous fear generation  mechanism   the same as with 
    September 11

    Elliott says constant media messaging supporting vaccination has 
    induced a sort of  mass psychosis  about vaccination and that she will 
    consider the vaccine when more is known about its long  term effects  

    She says her concerns include that there has been little public 
    discussion about  alternatives to the vaccine  and cites the drug 
    ivermectin  while trials are ongoing  ivermectin is not approved for 
    use as a Covid treatment in Australia and current scientific evidence 
    does not support its use  

     We  re actually all going a little mad and a lot of that is the 
    insistence of talking about jab  jab  jab  jab   Elliot says   I am 
    suspicious of the entire situation   

    She says the  sheep and the goats argument  is starting to become 
    unpleasant  

     Even in our personal life there are friends who won  t talk to me  
    People equate being obedient as being good  There  s a sort of a moral 
    thing going on and a lot of judgments  

     My personal opinion is you wear a mask when you  re face  to  face with a 
    shop assistant and that in August  that  s a good idea  The 
    micromanaging of people  s personal lives is a problem   

 Polarising views 

    Some views – like Elliott  s – are rationalised and nuanced  Others 
    appear formed by blatant online misinformation and paranoia  in a way 
    that resembles the rightwing QAnon conspiracy  

    Down the social media rabbit hole  a picture emerges of an organised 
    resistance to Covid restrictions  vaccinations and masks in 
    Mullumbimby  Byron Bay and other parts of the northern rivers

    A few months back  an information sheet headed  Please familiarise 
    yourself with the following points  was circulated among residents  
    advising them they could get around mask mandates by claiming a medical 
    exemption  Locals in Mullumbimby say the content is repeated daily by 
    dissenters in the same way politicians spruik daily talking points  

    Some shopfronts in Mullumbimby bear signs advising customers they will 
    be allowed in without a mask  no questions asked   and assumed to have 
    a medical exemption  

    At the other end of the spectrum  the St Vincent de Paul charity shop 
    has closed its doors several times when customers have refused requests 
    to wear masks  
    Vaccine hesitancy and variants mean Australia may not reach Covid herd

    This week local farmers  markets could have continued through lockdown 
    as an essential service but organisers said they had decided to close – 
    the  only option  given difficulties they have had ensuring compliance 
    with public health directives  

    Last month Mandy Nolan  a columnist for the local paper the Echo  wrote 
    about the ungluing of the Mullum community over Covid restrictions  

     Covid  19 has ripped our rainbow flag in two   she wrote   Our beliefs 
    have been polarised to such an extent that there no longer is a middle 
    ground  Our tolerance of each other has faded  Our mountain of goodwill 
    has gone   

    She told Guardian Australia   It scares me when a society loses its 
    empathy and compassion to care for its vulnerable  That  s the most 
    powerful thing we do  

     We are talking about a very loud  shouty and quite aggressive 
    minority  I called them cults without compounds

    She is hopeful that in a year from now  once vaccination rates are 
    high  the conflict becomes a distant memory and  stuff on the fringe 
    again   

     But the government  s inability to get people vaccinated has meant 
    we  ve amplified the space for the kind of conversations that I don  t 
    believe would be there if they  d done it quickly   Nolan says  

     The slow vaccine rollout has meant a very fast and prolonged rollout 
    of conspiracy  And the more the government fucks it up  the more 
     conspiracy  has been allowed to thrive   

 Calls for cooperation 

    Over and over  many locals tell a similar story  Three women who spoke 
    to Guardian Australia said they had chosen not to vaccinate their 
    children but that the Covid pandemic had shifted their views  

    What is perhaps most remarkable about the situation is the way the 
    individualism that has drawn people to the northern rivers has also 
    come to foster a sort of groupthink  
    Mullumbimby  s main street

     I moved here because everyone was accepted   said one woman  who did 
    not want to be named   Increasingly people have come to this area 
    thinking its a new age area  then it became this almost judgmental 
    thing  What yoga type you do  Do you shop at the Woolies or the IGA  
    That sort of thing  It  s not something new   

    Another said   I can  t believe the nastiness around something as 
    harmless as wearing a mask   

    One of the most prominent pushers of Covid dissent in Mullum is a man 
    otherwise known for his activism as a conservationist  On social media 
    these days he praises the climate  sceptic rightwing politicians Malcolm 
    Roberts and Craig Kelly  

     Funny where the truth is coming from these days   he wrote above a 
    link to a speech by Roberts complaining about limits on personal 
    freedoms  

    Zable posted a photo from his vaccine appointment on social media  He 
    was accused by some folks of being paid to  shill for Big Pharma  and 
    that he had  sold out man   
    Covid vaccine hesitancy halves among young people in Great Britain 
    Read more 

    He says nothing could be further from the truth  His decision was based 
    on the same set of ideas that underpinned the Aquarius festival and 
    transformed these valleys  

     The Age of Aquarius  it  s an invention   he says   It  s no cosmic 
    thing  It stands for cooperation  

     There  s these two basic theories in society  One is that the human 
    species is a cooperative species when push comes to shove  The other is 
    the survival of the fittest  

     Every scientist in the world is screaming that we  ve got nine years 
     to deal with climate change  This is what we should be focusing on  
    This is the test  Are we cooperative or we are just in it for 
    ourselves
