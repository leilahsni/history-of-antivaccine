    Celebrity culture tends to break into the American conscience in a way 
    that political culture hardly ever does  The latest gossip about Paris 
    Hilton  s wedding or Taylor Swift  s new album can dominate the national 
    conversation  Infrastructure legislation or Joe Biden  s latest poll 
    numbers  Not so much  

    So when a political debate piggy  backs on a cultural one  it can lend 
    the issue more potency  

    Such was the case this week  with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron 
    Rodgers  Sesame Street character Big Bird and Covid  19 vaccinations  

    On Sunday  Rodgers sat out his team  s NFL game against the Kansas City 
    Chiefs because he had tested positive for Covid  19  Rodgers is far from 
    the first professional athlete to miss time because of the novel 
    coronavirus  but his situation received extra scrutiny because it was 
    subsequently revealed that he had forgone being vaccinated and misled 
    the public about his immunity status  

    The quarterback explained all  or at least  attempted to  in a 
    remarkable interview with Pat McAfee on his SiriusXM sport talk show 
    last Friday  After describing himself as a  critical thinker  not an 
     anti  vax flat  earther  Rodgers went on to offer a bingo  card worth of 
    anti  vaccine talking points  with a dash of conservative  cancel 
    culture  critique thrown in  

    He said that he had put a lot of  time and energy  into researching the 
    vaccines and had  with the help of medical experts  come up with his 
    own homeopathic  immunisation protocol   and that he never actually 
    said he had been vaccinated  
       Ivermectin  How false science created a Covid  miracle  drug 
       • US court blocks Biden  s vaccine mandates for companies 

    He explained that he was now taking a variety of treatments  in 
    consultation with popular podcast host Joe Rogan  who contracted 
    Covid  19 in August   that included vitamins  monoclonal antibodies and 
    the off  label use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin  both of which 
    the Centers for Disease Control have warned against as Covid  19 
    remedies  

    He alluded to a history of  criminal activities and fraud cases  
    involving drug manufacturers and unsubstantiated concerns that the 
    vaccines could cause sterility  He cited Martin Luther King Jr  s moral 
    call to object to  unjust rules  And he lashed out against his 
    critics  of which there were many  

     I believe strongly in bodily autonomy and the ability to make choices 
    for your body  he said   not to have to acquiesce to some woke culture 
    or crazed group of individuals who say you have to do something  

    Those critics included former professional athletes like quarterback 
    Terry Bradshaw and NBA Hall  of  Famer Kareem Abdul  Jabbar  who said 
    Rodgers damaged professional sport by perpetuating the  dumb jock  
    stereotype  Dallas Cowboys receiver Cee Dee Lamb expressed confusion 
    over Rodgers  relatively modest 14460 NFL fine for violating its 
    Covid  19 policies  while he  s had to pay 20600 to the league for 
    uniform violations  Radio show host Howard Stern called Rodgers an 
     idiot

    Meanwhile  conservatives  many of whom have condemned vaccine and 
    mask  wearing mandates as government overreach  have taken up Rodgers  
    cause  

     Experts can be wrong  writes John Tamny  a vice  president at the 
    conservative think tank FreedomWorks   But despite this  despite 
    knowledge not having aged well at all  one of the greatest quarterbacks 
    ever is being criticised for deciding against one risk related to his 
    body while taking much greater ones with that same body on a daily 
    basis  

    Rodgers  situation is difficult to fit so easily into the 
    conservative  vs  liberal framework of ideological conflict  however  The 
    quarterback has always been a bit of a cypher  Raised in a small 
    California town  he was passed over by major collegiate athletic 
    programmes before becoming a star at the  very liberal  University of 
    California and  ultimately  being named most  valuable player in Green 
    Bay  s 2011 Super Bowl victory over the Pittsburgh  

    In a 2017 profile  Rodgers told author Mina Kimes that he doesn  t 
    identify with political parties but supports civil liberties  human 
    rights and addressing climate change  He defended NFL players who kneel 
    as a protest against racial injustice during the national anthem and 
    spoke out against a fan who shouted anti  Muslim slurs during a game  
    receiving a thank  you letter from Barack Obama  which he has said means 
    a lot to him  

    That  s prompted a particularly intense form of backlash against Rodgers 
    from the left  one tinged with a sense of betrayal  

     The thing about Aaron Rodgers is that we all thought he was smart  
    writes New York magazine  s Will Leitch   More than that  we thought he 
    was different  
       Why these US workers won  t get jabbed 
       Crime  hit Chicago grapples with police vaccine revolt 

    For instance  in that ESPN interview Rodgers described his personal 
    spiritual journey  about how he questioned his rigid childhood 
    religious beliefs and grew close to Rob Bell  a liberal Christian 
    minister  

    In hindsight  however  the parallels between Rodgers  challenging of 
     establishment  religious views and the conclusions of the medical 
    establishment are evident  

     I think organised religion can have a mind  debilitating effect  
    because there is an exclusivity that can shut you out from being open 
    to the world  he said  

    He also expressed a long  time distrust of the media that echoed last 
    week  s condemnations of the  woke mob  that he says is out to get him  

    It  s a flaw Slate  s Josh Levin identified as  excessive openmindedness  
     that Rodgers  in his attempt to present himself as a worldly  
    considered individual  failed to recognise a line between sceptism and 
    denialism

    Watch  US mothers divided on vaccines for young children 

    Crossing lines on Covid  19 has become a theme for the week  given the 
    other prominent vaccine  related cultural controversy  this one 
    involving what seemed to be a rather innocuous tweet from Big Bird  a 
    mainstay of the children  s show Sesame Street  

     I got my Covid  19 vaccine today  an account for the fictional bird 
    tweeted   My wing is feeling a little sore  but it  ll give my body an 
    extra protective boost that keeps me and others healthy  

    That prompted Texas Senator Ted Cruz to call the tweet  government 
    propaganda  directed at children  a critique that was echoed by other 
    conservative commentators and politicians  

    Congressman Chip Roy of Texas said the bird tweet was another example 
    of bureaucrats  undermining our freedom   The government  supported 
    Public Broadcasting Service funded Sesame Street for decades  Actor 
    Matthew Marsden drew a direct line from Aaron Rodgers to Sesame Street  

     How dare people take medical advice from Joe Rogan and Aaron Rodgers  
    he tweeted snarkily   They should take it from Elmo and Big Bird  

    For the most part  conservatives have aimed their criticism at 
    government  enforced vaccine  or  testing mandates and other mandatory 
    mitigation efforts  while still encouraging Americans to get 
    vaccinated  The response to Big Bird suggests the political ground on 
    the right is shifting  Efforts to promote vaccination among children  
    recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration  are being met 
    with growing scepticism  

    Parental rights  particularly when it comes to religious upbringing and 
    education  have long been a topic of Republican concern  so the 
    rhetorical ground was already set  

     When it comes to vaccines  it ought to be your choice  Cruz said in 
    defending his tweet   And what we  re seeing from Joe Biden  what we  re 
    seeing from a lot of big businesses  what we  re seeing from sports 
    leagues is they want to use government to force you to comply  And when 
    it comes to kids  I think that  s really pernicious

    Back to school causes fierce US debate over student masks 

    If that  s the terrain of the debate  it seems to be one the Democrats 
    will gladly fight on  given public approval polls support not just 
    vaccination but vaccine mandates  as well  

    Biden quickly tweeted out his support for Big Bird  saying it  s  the 
    best way to keep your whole neighbourhood safe  Former Democratic 
    presidential nominee Hillary Clinton tweeted a photograph of her with 
    the big yellow puppet  

    The speed with which political actors have arrayed for and against Big 
    Bird and Aaron Rodgers underlines the power that cultural touchstones 
    like the NFL and iconic children  s television programmes have in 
    American society  Politics  and political debates  may get scant 
    attention until they disrupt your team  s playoff chances or demean your 
    child  s favourite imaginary friend  

    The way the controversies played out  evolving into debates over 
    individual liberty  the role of  experts  in public policy and defining 
    community good  touch on familiar themes in US politics  however  And 
    they  re ones that are sure to resurface again  even if they don  t come 
    clad in football padding or yellow feathers
