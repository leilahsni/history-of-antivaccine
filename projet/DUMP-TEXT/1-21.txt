   Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic
   this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.

1. NHS set for £5.9bn boost to tackle backlog

   In an effort to help clear the huge - and record - backlog of people
   waiting for non-urgent tests and procedures, the government's
   announcing more money for the NHS in England. The extra £5.9bn included
   in Wednesday's Budget will fund more beds, equipment, new "surgical
   hubs" and also cover the costs of improving IT. According to Chancellor
   Rishi Sunak the money's "game-changing", and although welcomed by
   health bodies, they say staff shortages need to be fixed. Health
   services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive a
   proportionate amount of extra cash.

2. Protect schools from anti-vax protests - Starmer

   Describing it as "sickening" that protesters are spreading "dangerous
   misinformation" about vaccination, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is
   calling for councils to be able to use exclusion orders to stop
   anti-vaccination demonstrations taking place outside school gates. He
   urged the government to update the law and his suggestion comes as
   ministers also expressed concern about such demonstrations.

3. Beijing marathon postponed

   The Beijing marathon, one of China's biggest local sporting events, has
   been postponed until further notice amid a surge in coronavirus
   infections. Around 30,000 people were expected to take part on 31
   October but the country's top health official warned a fresh outbreak
   is expected to spread further. Those cases are linked to the highly
   transmissible Delta variant.

4. Risk of Covid spike after COP26

   The COP26 climate summit is a week away and ahead of world leaders
   gathering for the conference in Glasgow, Scotland's health secretary is
   warning there is "absolutely a risk" of Covid cases rising. Humza
   Yousaf says he expects to see a spike in cases after 25,000 delegates
   descend on the city but procedures are in place to mitigate
   transmission.

5. Is internet addiction a growing problem?

   A man, who realised his addiction to video games was out of control
   when he considered ending his life, says coronavirus lockdowns have
   been difficult for people like him. Cam Adair, 32, founded Game
   Quitters for people struggling with gaming addiction and says while he
   was able to stay away from a relapse during Covid, many of those in the
   online support group didn't. Read more here.
