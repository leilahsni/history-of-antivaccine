   Green Bay Packers

Anti-vaxxer Aaron Rodgers’ spectacular fall from grace happened in record
time

   The Green Bay star once vied for the status of the NFL’s most
   well-liked player. After Friday’s bizarre interview about his vaccine
   status, it’s safe to assume those days are behind him

   To think, Aaron Rodgers could be hosting Jeopardy! right now. Yes, the
   Green Bay Packers quarterback was at one point one of the leading
   candidates to host the iconic quiz show. He got rave reviews during his
   tenure as a guest host, even, becoming a sort of pop-intellectual
   figure in American life. Well, after Rodgers’ public-relations disaster
   of an interview on the Pat McAfee Show on Friday, they can consider
   themselves fortunate that they dodged at least one bullet on their
   star-crossed quest to replace the late Alex Trebek.

   Rodgers – who is currently unavailable to play with his team after
   testing positive for Covid-19 – went on the SiriusXM program after
   reports emerged revealing he was, at best, fudging the truth when he
   previously claimed he was “immunized” rather than fully vaccinated. The
   good news was that this time around, he was more direct. The bad news,
   was that he was probably way too honest for his own good.

   It could have been much easier for all involved. When given a chance to
   defend himself for not being vaccinated, Rodgers claimed he had “an
   allergy to an ingredient that’s in the mRNA vaccines”. Had he stuck
   with this line of defense, he could have deflected some of the
   criticism that was to come. Sure, after the “immunized” debacle,
   Rodgers would not have gotten the benefit of the doubt that he would
   have been given a week earlier, but it would have been far more prudent
   than the path he did take directly off the rails.

   Instead, Rodgers’ interview featured an avalanche of anti-vaxxer
   buzzwords and all-too-familiar phrases, each one laying bare the
   hollowness of his disclaimer that he was not “anti-vax”. You’ll never
   guess it, but Rodgers did his own research with the aid of none other
   than conspiracy theory-minded podcaster Joe Rogan. He confirmed that
   his personal “immunization protocol” included ivermectin and then
   proceeded to rail against (yawn) “the woke mob” and “cancel culture”.
   He even threw in a Martin Luther King Jr misquote, as if he were trying
   to pull off the Full Tucker Carlson.

   The interview, which inspired nonstop ridicule on social media,
   threatens to irrevocably hurt the reputation of someone who – just
   months ago – was one of the most beloved athletes in the country. Since
   replacing Brett Favre as Green Bay’s starter in 2008, Rodgers quickly
   became one of the NFL’s most bankable stars. He established himself as
   one of the most exciting and talented quarterbacks in the game and his
   charming off-the-field persona had, until recently, translated into a
   broad appeal that few other athletes could claim.

   How broad? A 2020 survey revealed that just 8% of respondents had a
   negative opinion of Rodgers. That’s quite impressive considering how
   little fun it is for non-Packers fans to watch the league’s reigning
   Most Valuable Player dismantle their team’s defenses on a regular
   basis. He even helped break down the stereotype that athletes couldn’t
   also be intellectually curious, a fact which ironically could be his
   undoing if it led him to take his current stance on Covid-19.

   His reputation will not survive this unscathed. As ESPN’s Mina Kimes
   points out, Rodgers’ irresponsible comments aren’t just harmless
   nonsense. Having already put others in danger with his decision, he
   added to the harm by going on record by spreading misinformation
   couched in the all-too-familiar language of the nation’s massive
   anti-vaccination movement. “My body, my choice” breaks down when we’re
   talking about infectious diseases.

   That point is key here. Rodgers isn’t the only NFL quarterback who has
   publicly pushed treatments of dubious medical value. One of the reasons
   that Tom Brady now plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is that the New
   England Patriots didn’t approve of his closeness to controversial
   “nutrition advisor” Alex Guerrero. Meanwhile, the Seattle Seahawks’
   Russell Wilson has been selling his fellow athletes on a type of water
   that supposedly helps treat concussions (there is no credible medical
   evidence that it does so).

   forgotten

   While both Brady and Wilson received some negative media attention for
   propping up what we will charitably call “unproven remedies”, they were
   smart enough to not escalate the bad press as Rodgers has. Also, to
   state something that should be obvious but clearly isn’t, there’s a
   difference in magnitude between making wild, untested claims about the
   benefits of drinking water and spreading proven disinformation during a
   pandemic.

   Rodgers isn’t heading towards a full-blown “cancellation”, however much
   as he seems to be itching for one. Conservative football fans – a
   significant portion of the NFL audience – will embrace him as one of
   their own. He’s already setting himself up for a profitable future in
   right-wing punditry circles. As his friend Rogan knows, there’s a lot
   of money to be made in calling out the so-called “woke mobs”.

   There will almost certainly be consequences, however. Rodgers might
   lose a few sponsorships and the NFL – probably more irritated at being
   criticized than the fact that Rodgers misled the public about his
   vaccination status – has already launched a media counterattack. The
   Packers also can’t be happy with any of this, but since Rodgers has
   already made it clear that he wants out of the organization that might
   be a feature rather than a bug.

   Rodgers’ pocketbook might take something of a hit, but as long as he’s
   one of the top quarterbacks in the league, he will be fine financially.
   Where the real damage will come will be in his public standing. Rodgers
   will never compete for the title of most-liked player in the league
   again and he has nobody but himself to blame. Not all defeats in the
   NFL happen on the field.
