   controversy

   Hugely popular US podcast host Joe Rogan has backpedalled on his
   comments that young, healthy people could forgo the coronavirus
   vaccine.

   "I'm not an anti-vax person," Rogan said. "I believe they're safe and
   encourage many people to take them."

   But Rogan did not walk back his suggestion that the young and healthy
   do not "need" vaccines, which drew backlash from White House officials.

   Experts say everyone over 16 should get vaccinated to stop the virus'
   spread.

   The Joe Rogan Experience was Spotify's most popular podcast in 2020,
   though the streaming giant did not share the number of times his
   episodes were downloaded. Rogan has more than seven million followers
   on Twitter and 12.5 million followers on Instagram.

   His podcast was acquired by Spotify last year for more than $100m
   (£77m).

   Asked about Rogan's comments, top US infectious disease expert Dr
   Anthony Fauci repeated guidance from experts that unvaccinated,
   asymptomatic people can still transmit Covid-19.

   "Even if you don't have any symptoms, you're propagating the outbreak,"
   Dr Fauci said.

   Rogan made the comments during a 23 April episode of his podcast, which
   was first reported by Media Matters this week.

   In that episode, Rogan told listeners that he would not suggest the
   vaccine to a healthy 21-year-old. "If you're a healthy person, and
   you're exercising all the time, and you're young, and you're eating
   well...like, I don't think you need to worry about this."

   Responding to the criticism on his podcast on Thursday, Rogan said the
   argument that young people need the vaccine "for other people" made
   sense.

   "But that's a different argument," he added.

   And Rogan stressed that he should not be a source of scientific advice.
   "I'm not a doctor," he said. "I'm not a respected source of
   information, even for me."

   The TV host-turned media mogul regularly courts controversy for his
   blunt and sometimes inflammatory style on air. He has been accused of
   making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcast. Rogan
   has denied these accusations and said his comments were taken out of
   context.

Risk v freedom of speech

   Analysis box by James Clayton, North America technology reporter

   Joe Rogan is a huge draw for Spotify - so much so, in fact, that his
   show was mentioned in Spotify's quarterly earnings call. Joe Rogan's
   podcast had "performed above expectations," the company said.

   Spotify wants to be the place you go to for podcasts and The Joe Rogan
   Experience is a major plank in that strategy. You might come for Joe
   Rogan, but stay to listen to other podcasts. Spotify says it's seen a
   "strong increase" in the number of people listening to podcasts since
   the pandemic hit.

   However wrapping yourself around a controversial figure like Rogan has
   its dangers - and this saga illustrates that risk.

   Rogan said when he signed the deal with Spotify that he would have
   editorial control. Spotify have publicly backed the podcaster.

   But of course Spotify does have the power to pull the podcast.

   As ever Big Tech says it's is trying to balance two things: risk to the
   public v freedom of speech.

   However there's always a third factor. Money.

   When the face of your podcast offering says something that US
   politicians, the White House and medical experts deride as dangerous -
   that doesn't look good for Spotify's brand.

   For now, it looks like Spotify is willing to back the podcaster, and
   Rogan will hope his retraction will draw a line under the matter.

   Rogan is not the only US public figure to be accused of anti-vaccine
   remarks.

   Current US Vice-President Kamala Harris said during the election
   campaign last year that she would not trust any vaccine approved by the
   Trump administration. Then-US Vice-President Mike Pence accused her of
   "playing politics with people's lives".

   comments

   Two coronavirus shots - by Pfizer and Moderna - were subsequently
   granted authorisation under Mr Trump. Ms Harris received the Moderna
   jab after the election and said then it was safe.

   Last year, both Rogan and Spotify faced criticism over the appearance
   of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his show.

   The streaming giant has so far stood by its star host, touting Rogan's
   podcast in its first quarter earnings report this week. Spotify did not
   immediately return a BBC request for comment.

   "We have 8 million creators, and hundreds of millions of pieces of
   content," Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told Bloomberg News. "We have a content
   policy and we do remove pieces that violate it."

   US and global health authorities have found Covid-19 vaccines to be
   safe and effective in preventing infection and safety checks continue
   throughout the world.

   Experts have warned that misinformation has been fuelling vaccine
   hesitancy.

   In the US, nearly 100 million people have been fully vaccinated. This
   week, President Joe Biden urged all Americans to get their jab, calling
   it a "patriotic duty".
