    Top loyalists to Donald Trump  who frequently push lies about election 
    fraud  have joined forces with conservative doctors touting unproven 
    Covid curesand vaccine skepticism  and like  minded evangelical 
    ministers at a series of events across the US this summer  
    Capitol riot inquiry to investigate whether Trump  s White House was 
    involved in attack 
    Read more 

    The conservative  ReAwaken America  tour – featuring ex  general Michael 
    Flynn and top Donald Trump loyalist donors – has held events in 
    Florida  Michigan and other states  

    It underscores how Trump  s allies  anti  vaccine doctors and 
    conservative preachers are amplifying baseless claims that are hurting 
    the nation  s public health and its democracy with potentially 
    far  reaching impacts  say pandemic and election experts  

    The tour comes as Covid cases soar and as Republican drives to pass 
    state laws weakening voting rights increase  While the tour has touted 
    Flynn  s key role  a Tulsa Oklahoma media figure and Christian 
    entrepreneur named Clay Clark has been instrumental in orchestrating 
    the gatherings – also dubbed  health and freedom  conferences – using 
    his  ThriveTime  podcast and radio show and Charisma News coverage  

    The ReAwaken events have featured talks by vaccine skeptics such as 
    Simone Gold  who was charged for taking part in the Capitol riot and 
    leads America  s Frontline Doctors  a rightist group that garnered 
    attention for touting dubious Covid  19 cures such as ivermectin and 
    hydroxychloroquine  

    Stella Immanuel  a Houston doctor who is part of Gold  s group and who 
    spoke at a Michigan ReAwaken rally on 20 August  gained notoriety last 
    year for public remarks at a Washington rally near the supreme court  
    suggesting America  s health problems were linked to alien DNA and sperm 
    from demons  

    Another doctor listed as a speaker at the rallies is Scott Jensen  a 
    former state senator and Fox News favorite who is running for governor 
    in Minnesota  Last year  Jensen was a candidate for Politifact  s  lie 
    of the year  for claiming baselessly that doctors were overcounting 
    Covid cases for their own financial gain  

    Further  the conservative tour has provided new audiences for rich 
    Trump donors such as Mike Lindell  the chief executive of MyPillow  who 
    has stated falsely that Trump would be reinstalled as president by 13 
    August  and Patrick Byrne  the former chief of Overstock  who 
    bankrolled with millions of dollars a spurious  audit  in Arizona  s 
    largest county that has drawn bipartisan fire for lacking merit  

    The ReAwaken meetings  which each appear to have drawn audiences in the 
    hundreds or more  have also taken place this year in Oklahoma and 
    California  with more slated for Colorado and Texas in coming months  
    Promotional materials indicate that attendees are asked to pay 250 for 
    general admission or 500 for VIP tickets  with pastors eligible for 
    half  price tickets  

    Voting rights lawyers and pandemic experts are troubled by the volume 
    of election and pandemic disinformation that the ReAwaken tour seems to 
    be spreading

     Many Americans believe the 2020 election was stolen  despite numerous 
    failed court cases alleging it and recounts that verified the results   
    said Gerry Hebert  who spent over two decades as a senior lawyer at the 
    justice department handling voting rights  

    Hebert added   People have refused to wear masks and get vaccinated 
    because of Covid disinformation campaigns  Lies and disinformation 
    campaigns can kill  both our fellow Americans and our democracy  and 
    this ReAwaken America tour seems designed to accentuate these 
    problems   

    Similarly  Covid experts say that the ReAwaken America tour is 
    exacerbating medical disinformation  

     These events are stark reminders of how Trump was elected in 2016 and 
    remains popular to this day  with many now vying to assume his mantle 
    in campaigning for elected office at all levels of governments   said 
    Irwin Redlener  who leads Columbia University  s Pandemic Resource and 
    Recovery Initiative  

     I  m actually embarrassed by the fact that there are doctors fully into 
    this craziness   

    Flynn  who was pardoned by Trump late last year after twice pleading 
    guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian 
    ambassador in the federal investigation into Kremlin meddling in the 
    2016 elections  has become a fixture at conspiracy  heavy gatherings 
    this year  including one in Texas in May that was backed by QAnon 
    advocates who have falsely claimed Trump will become president again 
    this year  

    Other Trump loyalists have popped up at the ReAwaken events  including 
    Roger Stone  a longtime Trump adviser who also was pardoned by Trump 
    after he was convicted of lying to Congress and other felonies as part 
    of the federal inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections  and 
    Charlie Kirk who runs the pro  Trump youth group Turning Point USA  

    Anne Nelson  the author of Shadow Network  a book about the rightwing 
    Council for National Policy  which boasts some key evangelicals  said 
    Clark  s ReAwaken tour has echoes of earlier  religious political 
    entrepreneurs  but said Clark  has modernized their techniques with 
    religious rallies and media platforms promoting Trump surrogates like 
    Michael Flynn and medical misinformation peddlers like Simone Gold  to 
    build momentum for the radical right  leading up to next year  s 
    midterms and 2024   

    The ReAwaken gatherings have dovetailed with more drives by 
    conservative doctors and Trump loyalists spreading pandemic and 
    election disinformation

    For instance  Gold  s America  s Frontline Doctors  which was formed with 
    the help of Tea Party Patriots early last year  filed a motion this 
    July aimed at the health department seeking to halt vaccinations  The 
    motion contained some widely debunked assertions about Covid  19  

    The discredited claims included that CDC data reveals that the two  shot 
    Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the single  shot Johnson  Johnson 
    vaccine are  not effective in treating or preventing  Covid  19  and 
    that the pandemic is not a public health emergency  

    Further  Gold  s group announced in May that it was launching a national 
    RV  Uncensored Truth Tour  with an initial focus on several states 
    including Arizona  Texas and Florida  

    Critics see the RV tour as another vehicle for Gold to spread 
    disinformation  as in her comments in Washington at a rally the day 
    before the Capitol attack  when she labeled FDA approved vaccines  an 
    experimental biological agent deceptively named a vaccine  and urged 
    people to avoid being  coerced   

    More broadly  Redlener is dismayed by the abundance of disinformation 
    at the ReAwaken America rallies  and via similar avenues   The 
    increasingly flagrant promotion of anti  science ignorance and bizarre 
    political extremism is worrisome   he said
