Facebook removes anti-vax influencer campaign

   Facebook has removed hundreds of accounts which it says were involved
   in anti-vax disinformation campaigns operated from Russia.

   The company said the network of accounts targeted India, Latin America
   and the US.

   They attempted to recruit influencers to spread false claims to
   undermine public confidence in particular Covid-19 vaccines, it added.

   In its latest report on "coordinated inauthentic behaviour", Facebook
   said it found links between the network and a botched disinformation
   campaign from influencer marketing agency Fazze - which is part of a
   Russian-based company called AdNow.

   Last month a BBC Trending investigation reported how in May this year
   influencers had been offered money by Fazze to spread false claims
   about the risks associated with the Pfizer vaccine.

   According to Facebook, that was the second wave of attempts by the
   network to smear Western vaccines.

   Their investigation found that from November 2020 the same network
   attempted to falsely paint the AstraZeneca vaccine as dangerous because
   it uses a harmless adenovirus taken from chimpanzees.

   Posts from accounts in the network spread memes that used images from
   the Planet of Apes films to give the impression the vaccine would turn
   people into monkeys.

   These posts appeared on Facebook in Hindi around the same time the
   Indian government was discussing emergency authorisation for the
   AstraZeneca vaccine.

   The campaign used fake accounts, some of which Facebook says probably
   originated from account farms in Bangladesh and Pakistan.

   Facebook said it had removed 65 Facebook accounts and 243 Instagram
   accounts for violating their policy against foreign interference.

   Ben Nimmo, Facebook's threat intelligence lead, described the campaign
   as "a disinformation laundromat" which planted content on a few online
   forums and then amplified that content on other platforms.

   The operation spanned over a dozen platforms. Misleading posts appeared
   on Reddit and Medium, and petitions appeared on change.org expressing
   concern about the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

   According to Facebook's report, these links were then shared by a
   handful of influencers on Instagram who used the same hashtags and made
   references to the fact that the AstraZeneca vaccine was derived from
   chimpanzee adenovirus.

   Both waves of the campaign were unsuccessful and failed to gain much
   traction - despite the diverse methods used.

   "In addition to the previously-exposed efforts to enlist social media
   influencers, this operation appears to have used a whole range of
   tactics in a wider effort to seed misleading narratives online about
   Western-made Covid vaccines," said Jack Stubbs, Director of
   Investigations at social media analytics firm Graphika.

   "There was a claimed hack-and-leak, the use of pay-to-publish
   pseudo-news sites, and a network of fake personas on Facebook and
   Instagram."

   campaign

   Despite the best efforts of the campaign, Facebook's report observed
   sloppy practices, including mixing languages - such as posting Hindi
   language memes accompanied by hashtags in Portuguese.

   BBC Trending's investigation showed Fazze was part of a Russian
   company, AdNow. The BBC made repeated attempts to obtain a comment from
   AdNow's headquarters in Moscow, but received no response. However, a
   director of AdNow's British arm told the BBC that Fazze was being shut
   down.

   In response to accusations by a German politician that discrediting
   Western vaccines was in the interests of the Kremlin, the Russian
   Embassy in the UK said: "We treat Covid-19 as a global threat and,
   thus, are not interested in undermining global efforts in the fight
   against it, with vaccinating people with the Pfizer vaccine as one of
   the ways to cope with the virus."

   The BBC has again attempted to contact Fazze for comment but the emails
   sent to Fazze addresses still bounce back from AdNow's domain.

   Facebook says Fazze is now banned from their platform.
