Cinema and big event organisers targeted by extreme anti-vax activists

   Anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine activists have used online groups to
   circulate the personal details of people helping to run cinema and
   other large-scale event trials. It's prompted some people to send
   abusive messages.

   "We must be approaching about 300 emails accusing us of things like
   being a part of a 'medical apartheid.'"

   George Wood is managing director of The Luna Cinema, which runs
   open-air film events. He agreed to participate in the government's
   pilot scheme to restart large-scale gatherings - but he didn't expect
   to receive abuse for doing so.

   The emails accuse Luna of being part of a "vaccine passport" scheme -
   even though attendees won't have to show proof of vaccination, only
   evidence of a recent negative Covid-19 test.

   The abuse includes personal attacks and even messages comparing the
   organisers to Nazis.

   "These claims are so ridiculous," says Mr Wood. "The staff are being
   distressed by it.

   "We are doing something positive for the industry," he says. "We're
   helping return the freedoms that have been removed by Covid."

   Mr Wood says that many of the people writing in used the same slogans
   and phrases, which seemed to indicate a co-ordinated campaign. And he
   says some of the more extreme messages have been referred to the
   police.

Harassment

   The targeting of The Luna Cinema isn't unique. The BBC has seen details
   posted online - including phone numbers and email addresses - of
   several people involved in a number of the mass event pilots.

   In one group of nearly 16,000 people on the chat app Telegram, contact
   details of organisers of the events were for a time pinned to the top
   of the chat. The group itself is devoted to Covid-19 and vaccine
   conspiracy theories.

   One post reads: "Help Kill The Government Trials That Will Inevitably
   Bring In Vaccine Passports", and goes on to list contact email
   addresses for organisers.

   Other posts, like this one, declare that the events "must fail":

   While the messages avoid specific calls to action, participants in the
   chat are prodded with phrases like "YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO". As Mr Wood's
   experience shows, some may interpret that as a sign to send abuse.

What are the pilots?

   The government is collecting data and research from a number of pilots
   around the country, including Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley
   Stadium, the World Snooker Championships in Sheffield and a number of
   other smaller events.
     * Trials to begin for return of England mass events
     * Comedy club's anger at vaccine passport error
     * 'Two-tier society' warning over Covid passports

   Findings from these events on testing, social distancing and
   ventilation will inform how mass venues can reopen safely after 21
   June, when all lockdown measures are currently planned to be lifted.

   The government's initial statement on the pilots referred to
   "Covid-status certification". However that phrase appears to have
   initially caused some confusion, with some interpreting it as a signal
   that participants would be required to show proof of a Covid
   vaccination.

   One venue, Liverpool's Hot Water Comedy Club, pulled out from the trial
   because of abuse over inaccurate reports it was involved in a "vaccine
   passport" trial.

   The cancellation was cheered in anti-vaccine groups.

   While there has been debate about the ethics of "vaccine passports" and
   the government has launched a review into Covid-status certification,
   the only requirement for entry into the mass event trials is a negative
   Covid test.

'Covid passports'

   As the exact requirements for the trials have become clearer, however,
   chat in more extreme anti-lockdown, anti-vaccine groups hasn't
   subsided. Instead, people consistently talk about the trials bringing
   in "vaccine passports" by the back door.

   Posts contain a range of suspicions - from mainstream worries about
   discrimination, all the way to hard-core conspiracy theories that the
   pandemic is somehow a "hoax" or has been "fabricated", alongside
   patently false assertions that vaccines are harming and killing
   millions.

   Some claim, again falsely, that Covid testing itself is somehow
   dangerous. There is also content from far-right activists.

   "In terms of the broader Covid conspiracy and anti-lockdown groups,
   threats and potential violence against people who may be talking about
   how society changes because of Covid are quite common," says Ciaran
   O'Connor, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

   "The thing about Telegram is that it's anonymous. Hate and anger is not
   only encouraged but also orchestrated in these spaces," adds Mr
   O'Connor. "You don't have to dig deep."

   The BBC has contacted Telegram for comment.
