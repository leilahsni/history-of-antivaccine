    Boris Johnson  s strategy for managing Covid over the winter has given 
    chills to most of the front pages  

    The Daily Express is warmest  hailing the prime minister as  Mr 
    Sensible  for including restrictions as part of his  Plan B  But the 
    Metro says Mr Johnson set out a  Covid winter warner  

     Plan for the Worst  says the Daily Mirror  The Daily Telegraph is 
    concerned that the  spectre of winter lockdown returns  It says Tory 
    MPs have expressed  astonishment  and disappointment at what they see 
    as a  slippery slope  towards inevitable curbs on freedoms  

    The Guardian focuses on the warning from government advisers that the 
    UK is at a  pivot point   and highlights Sage modelling that suggests 
    hospital admissions in England could peak at 7000 people a day next 
    month   Go hard  go early  Johnson told  says the Times  

     Surprise  It  s back to panic stations  is the verdict from the Daily 
    Mail   So much for the glorious promise that Britain  s road to 
    normality would be irreversible  

    It calls on the prime minister to  keep his side of the Covid bargain  
    insisting the public kept theirs by enduring lockdown without 
    complaint  

    The Sun argues Mr Johnson  s Plan A  looks reasonable  but warns he must 
     at all costs  avoid Plan B  It urges the him to  hold his nerve  and 
     turn a deaf ear  to those clamouring for restrictions at the first 
    hint of trouble  

    The Daily Star focuses on a row over the safety of vaccines between 
    England  s chief medical officer  Prof Chris Whitty  and the American 
    rapper  Nicki Minaj  calling it the  unexpected celebrity beef of the 
    decade  

    It says the  straight  laced British boffin   slapped down  the 
     misguided  star for spreading anti  vax nonsense and it agrees with his 
    view that she should be  ashamed  

    But the Mail says Nicki Minaj  hit back  in a series of tweets  
    including a  bizarre  audio clip mocking the prime minister in a fake 
    British accent after he too criticised her claims

    Tuesday  s announcement of a further delay to post  Brexit checks on some 
    EU goods entering the UK is highlighted by the Financial Times  

    It says Brexit Minister Lord Frost described the new timetable as 
     pragmatic  following supply chain problems the government has blamed 
    on the pandemic  

     It  s ironic  an EU diplomat tells the paper   They talked about 
    taking back control but are letting products in without any controls at 
    all  

    The Times says Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has been  given the 
    job of saving Christmas   after Mr Johnson asked him to fix the supply 
    chain issues in time for the festive season

    And images of the Democratic congresswoman  Alexandria Ocasio  Cortez  
    posing in a striking outfit at the Met Gala in New York on Monday night 
    are featured by several papers  

    The Financial Times reports that she  stunned  onlookers by wearing a 
    white gown daubed with  tax the rich  

    This led to accusations of hypocrisy  the Telegraph says  for making 
    the statement at an  exclusive  event costing £ 22000 a ticket  

    The Guardian acknowledges the move  was sure to ruffle some feathers   
    but says AOC  as she is widely known  was  happy to set the record 
    straight  writing on Instagram  the medium is the message
