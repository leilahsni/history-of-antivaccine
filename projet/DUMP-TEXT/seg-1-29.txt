    competing with the far right 

    The people of the Czech Republic go to the polls this weekend  as 
    billionaire  turned  politician Andrej Babis seeks another four years in 
    office  

    Mr Babis  leader of the populist ANO party  faces a tough challenge 
    from the centre  right opposition and also has the far right nipping at 
    his heels  And his fate is intertwined with the health of ailing 
    President Milos Zeman  

    A few weeks ago  Mr Babis took to Twitter  He had something on his 
    mind  

    Bikes instead of cars  I don  t want that  Do you  

    The tweets came thick and fast  

    Tax rises  I don  t want that  Do you  

    A few seconds later  

    They want to let Brussels decide everything  I don  t want that  Do you  

    And there was more  

    They would punish the honest and hard  working  I don  t want that  Do 
    you  

    And on and on  in an almost Trumpian stream of consciousness  

    The target was clear  the opposition Pirate Party and others the prime 
    ministers dismisses as  neo  Marxists  and  eco  terrorists  

    If Mr Babis  s voters were left in any doubt  shortly afterwards there 
    was a video  showing a rabid horde of millennials waving placards 
    reading  Refugees Welcome   Tax People  s Flats  and  Lower 
    Pensions  

    The slogan   I don  t want that  Do you

    by the SARS  CoV  2 coronavirus can vote across country in drive  in 
    polling stations in advance of the parliamentary elections Image

    The strategy appears to be to scare the living daylights out of ANO  s 
    older  less educated voter base and make sure they  re mobilised for the 
    two  day election on Friday and Saturday  

    Unlike Donald Trump  it  s doubtful Andrej Babis actually types any of 
    this stuff himself  

    ANO  s campaign relies heavily on a professional  well  oiled marketing 
    machine  with PR gurus tweaking every tweet and Facebook post  

 Fighting on two fronts 

    So far it  s served him well  but will it be enough this time around  

    Mr Babis  who now adopts a clenched  fist  pugilistic pose on campaign 
    billboards  is fighting this election on two fronts  

    On one flank are two opposition coalitions  Spolu  Together  is a group 
    of three conservative and Christian Democrat parties  

    PirStan is a coalition between the Pirates  who already control the 
    capital Prague  and Stan  a grassroots movement formed by local mayors 
    and independents

    minister 

    But he  s also competing with the far right  

    Tomio Okamura and his SPD party are looking to capitalise on fear of 
    migrants  economic insecurity and anti  vax sentiment

    The far  right SPD is calling for a referendum on pulling out of the 
    European Union 

    They have lofty ambitions for a place at the top table when the 
    post  election negotiations begin  Their price for entering government  
    a referendum on leaving the EU  

  It wasn  t pretty  

     The Czech Republic is at a crossroads  between old and new  east and 
    west if you like  said Ludek Stanek  a commentator and stand  up 
    comedian  

     The general concern is that we will be pushed more into the Russian 
    sphere  And that  s something you don  t want because I remember the 
    Russian occupation  and it wasn  t pretty  It wasn  t fun  he added  

    Some believe Mr Babis is so isolated and his coalition potential so 
    reduced that a government with the far right will be his only path to 
    staying in power  

    But surely this Nato and EU member is too tightly locked into Western 
    structures for any political arrangement to change that

     You  re from Britain  said Ludek Stanek   You were locked into the 
    European Union and within five years you were out  

 Pandora  s box 

    All this was already fraught before Mr Babis was named in the huge 
    Pandora Papers leak  which revealed he had used offshore companies in 
    the British Virgin Islands to acquire property worth 22 m on the French 
    Riviera  

    PANDORA PAPERS  Secret wealth of leaders exposed 

    He counters that the transactions were totally legal  the money was 
    fully taxed  and anyway they took place in 2009  years before he 
    entered politics  He  s threatened to sue the Pirate Party  s dreadlocked 
    leader for calling the transaction  money  laundering  

    But the Pandora leaks are far from Mr Babis  s biggest problem  

    His political future lies in the hands of ailing President Milos Zeman  

    Mr Zeman  who has already said he will vote for ANO  says he will 
    nominate the leader of the largest party to form a new government  This 
    will almost certainly be Mr Babis  

    The president describes the opposition coalitions as a  fraud  on the 
    electorate

    Rumours that the ailing president is seriously ill have been denied 

    But Mr Zeman is not well  

    The 77  year  old president  a heavy smoker and former heavy drinker  
    suffers from Type 2 diabetes and uses a wheelchair  

    He was recently hospitalised for eight days with no official 
    explanation  After two days of silence his spokesman responded with a 
    cryptic tweet quoting the Bible  

    The president  s office later announced Mr Zeman was suffering from 
    exhaustion and dehydration  But there were new rumours this week  
    officially rebutted  that his condition was more serious  

    His chancellor was even forced to deny in a radio interview that he was 
    dead  

    No  he said  he was looking forward to casting his vote on Friday and 
    playing an active role in post  election negotiations  

    If for whatever reason he is unable to  there could be even more 
    uncertainty
