    Doctors say there have been millions of Covid  19 vaccine doses given  
    with  few significant side effects  

     Get the jab  grab a poke  It was a catchy slogan with a serious 
    message about getting a Covid  19 vaccination  with a free ice  cream 
    afterwards  

    But despite such incentives and pleas for younger people to get the 
    jab  figures show the number of young people being vaccinated remains 
    relatively low  

    Latest figures show about 59 of those aged 1829 have received a 
    vaccine  whereas uptake in other age groups is significantly higher  

    Government advice states that vaccinated people are less likely to 
    spread the infection by becoming ill  

    But one young man  who spoke to BBC News NI  said he did not see the 
    need for a jab  

     I couldn  t be any fitter or healthier so why would I go and inject 
    something into me to stop me getting something that would have zero 
    effect on me  he told Good Morning Ulster last week  

     It  s not that I  m dead against it  if I have to get one to fly I 
    probably will  but if you get the double vaccine you still get the 
    virus and you still pass it on anyway  so what  s the point in it

    Ellie  Jo Taylor believes the majority of young people are in favour of 
    being vaccinated 

    Ellie  Jo Taylor  a secondary school student from Londonderry  disagrees 
    with this viewpoint  

    She believes the majority of young people are in favour of being 
    vaccinated  

     We  re in a situation where we can  t afford not to be  she said  

     If we don  t  we could potentially enter the third year of our 
    education being hugely impacted  

    Ellie  Jo said she knows many students are  incredibly unnerved  by the 
    prospect of further isolation  particularly with exams on the horizon  

    She also said some young people feel like vaccination is the only way 
    to reclaim their youth  

     I entered the pandemic when I was 15  I  m 17 now  I don  t want to be 
    17 and come out with no experience of a teenage life  she said  

     Young people are entitled to much better things than self  isolation 
    and social isolation  Let  s take the steps to get them

     The only place I  ve seen anti  vax comments have been on the sides of 
    buildings  said one teenager 

    Last week  the Covid  19 vaccination programme in the Republic of 
    Ireland was extended to include 12 to 15  year  olds  

     I  m entirely jealous  Ellie  Jo said   I wish it was me and I think all 
    my friends feel the same  

    Most people she knows do not take anti  vaccine messaging too seriously  

     The only place I  ve seen anti  Covid  anti  vax comments have been on 
    the sides of buildings or on forums like Facebook  which predominantly 
    aren  t used by young people  she said

    People attending Belsonic festival will have to show proof of Covid 
    antibodies  vaccination or a negative test 

    Now  many people are being asked to prove their Covid status to attend 
    future events  

    People attending F é ile an Phobail in Falls Park in west Belfast next 
    month will have to show proof of Covid  19 antibodies  vaccination or a 
    negative test  

    The organisers of the Custom House Square and Belsonic music events in 
    Belfast have announced similar requirements  

    Promoter Joe Dougan said the plans had prompted some adverse feedback 
    on social media  

     It is understandable because this is a new message to be put out 
    there  he said  

     This might not have been the best commercial decision for us  but 
    safety is important and if you don  t have a vaccination there are other 
    options  

    However  there are real concerns that vaccine hesitancy among young 
    people could have a serious long  term implications  

    While younger people are less likely to die from Covid  19  a study 
    found those who end up in hospital are almost as likely as other age 
    groups to suffer from complications with kidneys  lungs and other 
    organs  
       How many under  30 s are unvaccinated  
       Offer Covid jab to over  12 s  says ex  minister Weir 
       Irish vaccine programme to include 1215  year  olds 

    Dr Laurence Dorman  chair of the Royal College of GPs in Northern 
    Ireland  said some concerns expressed by young people were 
    understandable  

     Some have a phobia of needles  some people are worried about this 
    being a new vaccine  he said  

    He said there had been millions of Covid  19 vaccine doses given  with 
     very few significant side effects  

     More importantly  it is working and we recommend it  he added  

    He acknowledged young people were also worried about conspiracy 
    theories  

     Various patients will tell us stories of things they have heard on 
    social media and online but our advice is always the same  we accept 
    the evidence that the vaccine is safe and works

    Some people have a fear of needles which can lead to them delaying a 
    vaccine appointment 

    Dr Dorman said GPs have first  hand experience with young people who are 
    suffering from Covid  19  adding that the under 30 s should  grab all 
    opportunities to get the vaccine  to help defeat the virus  

 Fear of needles 

    Emma  27  recently decided to get the jab when she became worried she 
    would be denied access to gigs  nightclubs or be forbidden from 
    travelling  

    She was apprehensive about the vaccine and delayed making an 
    appointment due to a fear of needles  

     When it first came out people were freaking out because it came out so 
    quickly and young women were worried about fertility and stuff like 
    that  she said  

     That was the main fear for young girls  especially  

    Medical experts have said claims on social media that the Covid vaccine 
    could affect female fertility are unfounded  

 Vaccination in school  

    The Secondary Student  s Union of Northern Ireland  SSUNI  which 
    represent up to 35000 pupils  has called for vaccines to be rolled out 
    for students on school premises  

     It  s not that young people are against vaccines  more the hassle of 
    getting it  SSUNI President Morgan Shuttleworth said  

     School halls have been used for vaccinations for years now  

     That would be a lot less hassle for an 18  year  old who  instead of 
    having to get a bus from Carrickfergus to the Odyssey  could just walk 
    into their school hall at lunch  

    The SSUNI has also written to the Joint Committee on Vaccine and 
    Immunisation  JCVI  calling for it to consider vaccinating all school 
    year groups due to take exams over the coming year  

    At present  health officials are not recommending routine universal 
    vaccination of people under 18  

    However  some children over 12 with specific underlying health 
    conditions and who are at risk of serious illness from the virus are 
    eligible for a jab  

  A feeling of invincibility  

    At Stormont  s health committee on Thursday  the chief scientific 
    officer Prof Ian Young appealed to people to get the jab  

     There has been a concern that the willingness of the Northern Ireland 
    population to come forward for vaccination  for whatever reason  seems 
    less than that in other parts of the UK  he said  

     And that will lead to a larger susceptible population in Northern 
    Ireland and therefore the potential for a more severe wave than on this 
    occasion  

    Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride admitted that young people 
    can have a  feeling of invincibility  almost that this is something 
    which isn  t necessarily going to affect you  

     Covid is not the flu  Covid is a very nasty virus which kills  and has 
    killed  a lot of people  he added  

     Extreme tiredness  shortness of breath  heart palpitations  chest pain 
    or tightness  problems with your memory and your concentration  changes 
    to your taste and smell  joint pain  depression  as a young person is 
    that what you really want
