 Coronavirus vaccine  Labour calls for emergency censorship laws for anti  vax 
 content 

    Shadow culture secretary says government should  stamp out  
    misinformation

    Coronavirus in numbers 

    The government should bring forward emergency legislation to  stamp 
    out  dangerous anti  vax misinformation ahead of the roll  out of the 
    Covid  19 vaccine  Labour has said  

    The shadow culture secretary  Jo Stevens  and the shadow health 
    secretary  Jonathan Ashworth  have written to the government warning 
    that  our historic strength in vaccine uptake must not be taken for 
    granted  as the prospect of a treatment for the virus looms  

    Keir Starmer  s shadow ministers are calling for financial and criminal 
    penalties for social media companies that fail to censor posts 
    promoting anti  vaccination content  which they note is rampant on those 
    platforms  

    The opposition ministers say anti  vaccination groups with almost 
    100000 users can be found within seconds of logging on to Facebook  

    An analysis by a think tank  the Centre for Countering Digital Hate  
    suggests that misinformation and disinformation about vaccines is also 
    spreading on newer forms of social media  such as TikTok  where the 
    hashtag vaccinesaredangerous has almost 800000 views

       Covid vaccine fraud is  emerging threat  to UK  NCA says 
       Brexit won  t disrupt Covid vaccine delivery  government says 

    In addition  dozens of anti  vaccination petitions have been posted on 
    the government  s website  some with almost 200000 signatures  

     The government has a pitiful track record on taking action against 
    online platforms that are facilitating the spread of disinformation   
    said Ms Stevens  

     It has been clear for years that this is a widespread and growing 
    problem and the government knows  because Labour has been warning them 
    for some time  that it poses a real threat to the take  up of the 
    vaccine  

     This is literally a matter of life and death  and anyone who is 
    dissuaded from being vaccinated because of this is one person too 
    many   

    In the joint letter  the two shadow secretaries of state said that 
     groups flagged months ago to social media companies remain active   
    despite commitments by the government and industry  

    Last week  social media giants agreed a package of measures with 
    ministers to tackle anti  vaccine misinformation  Facebook  Twitter and 
    Google promised to  step up work with public health bodies to promote 
    factual and reliable messages  and committed to  swifter responses to 
    flagged content   

    The digital secretary  Oliver Dowden  said that  Covid disinformation 
    is dangerous and could cost lives   and that there was  much more that 
    can be done  to counter it  

    However  the government has stopped short of saying such misinformation 
    should necessarily be removed  instead raising the prospect that it 
    could instead be de  monetised  given that  making money from this 
    dangerous content would be wrong   

    Imran Ahmed  a former Labour adviser who runs the Centre for Countering 
    Digital Hate  said   Despite big tech  s promises  Google is still 
    funding anti  vax misinformation websites by placing advertisements on 
    them  while Facebook  Instagram  Twitter and YouTube give well  known 
    anti  vaxxers a platform to spread dangerous conspiracy theories and 
    lies to millions of users

     Throughout the coronavirus pandemic  big tech has made bold claims of 
    intent  but failed to follow through with effective action  It is vital 
    that there are sanctions when social media companies fail to fulfil 
    their duty of care to users and society at large  The government must 
    stop falling for big tech  s excuses  and introduce financial and 
    criminal penalties for failures that lead to serious harm  

     We have all done our bit to contain coronavirus  It  s beyond time for 
    social media companies and regulators to do their bit too   

    Free speech campaigners however warned that the approach could be 
    counterproductive and  push the argument underground   

     In the midst of a public health emergency ensuring that there is 
    accurate information about treatments and vaccines is key   Ruth 
    Smeeth  chief executive of Index On Censorship told The Independent  

     However we can  t ignore that people may challenge and push back 
    against the scientific facts  Surely the answer isn  t to ban the 
    anti  vaxxers but to explain why they are wrong on every available 
    platform  

     Demonstrate why the science is right rather then push the argument 
    underground where rational argument will be lost
