 People are being infected by anti  vaxx lies – and that should be made illegal 

    An anti  vaxxer could infect 12 people and 12 more after that  it  s 
    the wilful infection of our parents  grandparents and friends 

    Celia Walden 16 November 2020 • 700 pm Celia Walden 

     You wouldn  t actually have the jab   my cab driver baulks  staring 
    back at me in his rear view mirror  There  s a moment  s silence in which 
    I regret having tried to make conversation with a cheery  what about 
    this Pfizer vaccine  eh  That  s the game  changer we needed   and debate 
    whether it might be better for both my blood pressure and his to find a 
    polite get  out and end this here  

    But with his outraged brows and wide conspiracy  theorist pupils  he  s 
    prodded the bear  and woken the beast  I hear myself reply in as 
    measured a tone as I can manage   Not only would I have it  but I  d 
    have it as soon as it  s rolled out  Hell – they can even double  dose me 
    if they want    But it  s made in China   the cabbie flings back  Deep 
    breath   No  It  s not  Pfizer is an American company  and BioNTech is 
    German   His eyes narrow   That  s what they  re telling us   

    It  s when the sinister  they  makes an appearance that any conversation 
    with an anti  vaxxer must be curtailed  along with every attempt at 
    logic   They  are the amorphous dark forces unaccountably apparently 
    trying to poison us all   they  are the hooded villains at the heart of 
    every anti  vax group  s stream of disinformation  

    When I wrote about the 14 per cent of Brits who declared they  would 
    not want to be vaccinated against the coronavirus even if a 
    high  quality vaccine were available  back in July  my inbox was filled 
    with  theys  for weeks afterwards  So it was heartening to read the 
    findings of a recent survey by ORB International – published on Sunday 
    – in which four out of five Brits agreed that those who spread anti  vax 
    disinformation should face prosecution  

    We  re not talking about people like my cab driver being hauled off in 
    cuffs  although by the end of that 20  minute journey and his detailed 
    explanation of why Turkish scientists couldn  t be trusted either  I was 
    fantasising about worse fates  but the heads of anti  vax groups with 
    hundreds of thousands of members who are still churning out 
    disinformation  Those people  like the  phone masters  who claimed 5 G 
    networks were causing the spread of Covid  aren  t just stupid  they  re 
    dangerous  

    As Shadow Culture Secretary Jo Stevens rightfully pointed out when she 
    branded the Government  s record on tackling disinformation throughout 
    the pandemic  pitiful    This is literally a matter of life and death 
    and anyone who is dissuaded from being vaccinated because of this is 
    one person too many   

    Only it  s not just one too many  as we know from our current R  rate  
    but the added 12 people they will in turn infect  and the 12 people 
    after that  it  s the wilful infection of our parents and grandparents  
    our vulnerable friends and relatives  So yes  the propagation of 
    potentially fatal lies should be made illegal  And yes  as Imran Ahmed  
    chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate has said  the 
    Government needs to step up when it comes to  falling for Big Tech  s 
    excuses  and introduce financial and criminal penalties for failures 
    that lead to serious harm   

    When I read one of ORB International  s further findings – that only 
    half of the 2000 people questioned believed a vaccine produced in 
    record time could be safe – I wasn  t surprised  I thought back to some 
    of the emails I got in response to my July column  Not the ones 
    peppered with ominous  theys  but also the carefully thought out 
    messages from self  described  vaccine hesitants  who simply wanted more 
    information before giving their informed consent  

    There were readers who started their defensive emails with  we are not 
     anti  vaxxers  nor  Covid deniers  and consider ourselves 
    well  balanced   and went on to explain their concerns about a vaccine 
     that has not been widely tested   One told me about the devastating 
    effects of Thalidomide on a family friend  while another – a devout 
    Catholic – explained his fears that the only successful vaccine might 
    be developed using the cell  lines from aborted foetuses  making it 
    morally repugnant to those with the same beliefs  

    Catholics should be able to rest easy in the knowledge that the Pfizer 
    vaccine wasn  t made using such cells but through genetic sequencing 
    using computers  Everyone should be able to find out precisely how the 
    new Moderna vaccine – which is showing early signs of being 95 
    effective – was developed  But that kind of information can only reach 
    its target audiences if public health messaging around vaccines is 
    strong enough  if legitimate questions are being answered 
    comprehensively  and if the kind of anti  vax groups who swoop and prey 
    on our fears are stamped out  

    Otherwise there will be smoke without fire  The spreaders of 
    misinformation and disinformation specialise in dropping precisely the 
    kind of smoke bombs that obscure fact and rationality   They  are the 
    hooded villains and the unregulated  not the scientists working day and 
    night to free us from this pandemic  

     They  are the poison we should fear most
