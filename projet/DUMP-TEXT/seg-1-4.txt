    Phil Valentine  a prominent Tennessee rightwing talk radio host  had 
    released a song called Vaxman  an anti  Covid vaccination ditty based on 
    the Beatles track Taxman  

    Marc Bernier  a host in Daytona Beach  Florida  had declared himself 
     Mr Anti  Vax   Dick Farrel  also from Florida  urged his listeners not 
    to get vaccinated  and Jimmy DeYoung asked on air whether the vaccine 
    could be a  form of government control of the people   

    All four men died in August of coronavirus  A fifth conservative radio 
    host  Bob Enyart  died on 13 September  weeks after he told his 
    listeners to boycott vaccines that were  immorally developed   

    The death of the men  just weeks apart  illustrated both the depth of 
    anti  vaccine feeling among some conservatives  but also hinted at the 
    problems rightwing talk radio  along with other conservative media  is 
    causing as vaccination rates in the US have slowed  

    Local talk radio is not often mentioned in discussions about 
    conservative media and messaging in America  

    Fox News and even more extreme rightwing television channels like 
    Newsmax – which describes itself as pro  vaccine – and One America News 
    draw the headlines  and Facebook is often noted as a source for 
    conspiracy theories  but behind the scenes thousands of small radio 
    stations make up a patchwork of conservative media across the US that 
    is enjoyed by millions  

    In terms of the spread of misinformation  talk radio  s impact is 
    unappreciated  Angelo Carusone  president of Media Matters  a 
    progressive media watchdog  said  

     It is clearly a driving force  A lot of people understandably focus on 
    online  especially when it comes to anti  vax information  But the 
    reality of it is  when the dust settles  I think what we  re going to 
    find is that the real source of a lot of the most damaging anti  vax 
    messaging was driven largely by traditional media  talk radio and 
    traditional rightwing forces like Fox News   he said  

     When we think about talk radio  the reason it has had such influence 
    is the reach  It still is reaching the largest number of people  Fox 
     News  is going to reach a couple of million people a day  Talk radio 
    is reaching 40 million  60 million people depending on the day  maybe 
    even more  

     The guys who are dying  you could treat them as  having  small radio 
    shows  but they have really high concentration in their communities   

    These radio hosts can be even more outspoken than their equivalents on 
    Fox News  Personalities on the rightwing TV network tend to be careful 
    about how they address vaccine opposition  urging viewers to  speak to 
    a doctor  and make their own decisions before getting vaccinated  
    rather than telling people outright to avoid the shots  

    There is less direct anti  vax messaging on Fox News  but a recent 
    report by Media Matters still found that 60 of the network  s 
    vaccination coverage  included claims undermining or downplaying 
    vaccinations   

    Those claims and the network  s output leave Fox News open to 
    suggestions of hypocrisy  this week it was revealed that the vast 
    majority of employees at Fox Corporation  which includes Fox News  are 
    vaccinated  and those who are not have to undertake daily Covid tests 
    to continue to work  

    A Fox News spokesperson pointed the Guardian to a Washington Post study 
    which found that people who got their news from Facebook were less 
    likely to be vaccinated than those who got their news from Fox News  
    The same study found that Fox News viewers were less likely to be 
    vaccinated than the general population  

    According to the CDC 64 of all Americans have received at least one 
    dose of the vaccine  and 55 are fully vaccinated  Among those 18 and 
    over  77 of people have received one dose  and 66 of people are fully 
    vaccinated  

    On rightwing talk radio stations across the country  hosts stick to 
    their guns – as the recent deaths indicate  

     Talk radio has always bashed elites and the mainstream media  and I 
    think it is an extension of that to be questioning the public health 
    professionals who are the ones handing down  seemingly from on high  
    these ever changing public health edicts tied to masks and vaccines and 
    other things   said Brian Rosenwald  a scholar  in  residence at the 
    University of Pennsylvania and author of Talk Radio  s America  How an 
    Industry Took Over a Political Party That Took Over the United States  

    While radio hosts might be the public voice of that skepticism  it is a 
    common misconception that audiences are  puppets   Rosenwald said  
    Instead  it  s radio hosts who might find themselves  entrapped by what 
    the audience wants to hear   

    At the beginning of the pandemic  many rightwing talk radio hosts were 
    publicly skeptical  and  not wishing to lose listeners  and with them 
    advertisers  they had backed themselves into a corner  

     There was a lot of   Come on  this is no worse than the flu  are we 
    really shutting down over the virus  There was a lot of   Who the hell 
    are these people to be shutting down the world   Rosenwald said  

     Now flash forward  if you  ve started off there in March 2020  when you 
    factor in the general culture to begin with  skeptical of elites  it 
    really doesn  t leave you a lot of room to then reverse course when we 
    get to the point that there are vaccines  

     There  s no easy moment to say   Look  I know I  ve questioned the 
    public health professionals  I  ve questioned the whole thing  but you 
    should listen to them now  go get vaccinated  To some extent the genie 
    is out of the bottle at that point   

    For a radio station to acquire a broadcast license  it has to promise 
    two things  Carusone said  One  not to overpower your antenna  and two  
     Promise that you are fit and proper  that you fit at minimum the basic 
    tenets of getting a license to broadcast   But the latter is often 
    little  policed  Carusone said  

     At minimum I think it  s a little bit insane that we  ve allowed the 
    whole process about getting a broadcast license to become so pro  forma 
    that it doesn  t matter if your radio hosts are out there dying from 
    their own misinformation   he said  

     From a regulatory perspective it would be great if there were some 
    rules around this  but at minimum I feel like we already have an 
    avenue  which is if the FCC just treated this as part of the standard 
    license requirement it would help – by telling  talk radio hosts   At 
    minimum you should be careful what you say  

     They think they can get away with murder  And in this case  not even 
    metaphorically any more   

    At least two of the five radio hosts who died had a change of heart as 
    they became seriously ill  

    In late July  after Valentine had been hospitalized from Covid  19  his 
    brother Mark Valentine appeared on Nashville  s WWTN  FM himself  

     For those listening  I know if he were able to tell you this  he would 
    tell you   Go get vaccinated  Quit worrying about the politics  Quit 
    worrying about all the conspiracy theories   Mark Valentine said  His 
    brother died on 21 August  

    Farrel  who died on 4 August  also changed his mind  his friend Amy 
    Leigh Hair told the Washington Post  

     When he got very sick  he texted me and said   This pandemic ain  t no 
    joke  Get the shot   Hair said  

     He definitely admitted he hadn  t taken it seriously  At the end of the 
    day  he was sorry about that
