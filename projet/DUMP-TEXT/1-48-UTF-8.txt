Coronavirus doctor's diary: Will vaccine sceptics make trials a headache?

   It will soon be critical for the NHS to start vaccinating people
   against flu, to prevent hospitals being swamped with flu and Covid-19
   patients this winter. Large-scale trials of Covid-19 vaccines, already
   under way in some places, are likely to start in Bradford in the
   autumn. It's therefore worrying, says Dr John Wright of the city's
   Royal Infirmary, that anti-vax conspiracy theories seem to have
   flourished in this pandemic.

   The numbers of hospital patients continue to slowly decline, almost
   down to single figures this week. There is great relief in the
   hospital, tempered by the inevitability of a further spike of
   infection. We know of the warning from Game of Thrones - winter is
   coming - and never before has that phrase been so ominous. The
   prediction of a second wave of Covid-19 in January, with the added
   layer of an influenza epidemic, is our worst fear. So we will be
   working hard to make sure we vaccinate as many people for flu as we can
   in the autumn.

   The race for an effective Covid-19 vaccine continues at pace. Over 130
   candidate vaccines have now been developed and more than 30 are in
   clinical trials, with some showing promising early signs.

   At the Bradford Institute of Health Research we are one of just five
   national centres for patient recruitment to clinical trials, and have
   lots of expertise with testing new drugs. However vaccine trials are a
   completely different ball game. Rather than trialling new drugs on a
   small number of patients with specific diseases we will be testing new
   vaccines on hundreds and thousands of healthy volunteers. We have been
   exploring how we could use sports centres or community halls to recruit
   these volunteers, and how we can scale up our research teams to cope
   with the numbers.

   We have been preparing for two different vaccine trials, only for the
   companies to pull them from the UK at the last minute and move them to
   the Americas. The pandemic fires have been dampened in Europe, but in
   the US and Latin America they continue to rage, and if you are going to
   test a new vaccine you need countries where the virus is still
   accelerating.

   But despite these two false starts, there will be further trials of
   other candidate vaccines.

   It's therefore important to win the support of the public so that they
   sign up to these new trials, and to do that we need to counter some of
   the growing false news stories we are hearing on our community
   grapevines, which are leading people to believe that the vaccines are
   harmful.

Front line diary

   Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford
   Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola
   epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News
   and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.

   I wrote before about the abusive messages sent to one of our
   consultants, Fozia Hayat, who was accused of having blood on her hands
   when she tried to rebut the idea that hospitals leave patients from
   ethnic minorities to die. A conspiracy theory circulating in Bradford,
   which says that Bill Gates is using vaccines to implant microchips in
   patients, was aired on the news in Pakistan, she has learned. It
   appears these ideas are spreading nationally and internationally on
   social media.

   I have also written about Mohammed Azeem, a young man who delayed
   coming to hospital until he was at death's door because he believed the
   myth that ethnic minority patients never leave the wards alive (though
   thankfully he did, after 48 days in intensive care).

   Here are some more examples of the problems we are up against.

Refusing antibody tests

   In Bradford we recruited 12,500 pregnant women into a cohort study
   between 2007 and 2010, and have been monitoring the health of their
   children ever since. We have started to offer some of them antibody
   testing, and have been picking up on ideas such as, "You're putting a
   microchip in us," or "This is all a plot." This is clearly something we
   need to understand and deal with ahead of the vaccine trials.

'Everything seems to be a big lie'

   A healthcare assistant in the hospital, who doesn't want to be named,
   has seen Covid patients on the ward - but she still believes many of
   the conspiracy theories online. She doesn't watch any mainstream media
   reports. "I follow people who I believe know what they are talking
   about... I don't need to check them out, I get a gut feeling - I think
   more than anything that there's a big lie in the world. At the moment
   everything seems to be a big lie. Nobody knows what's true and what's
   not."

'Things will be hidden in the vaccine'

   Giselle Rwegema, a TB nurse at St Luke's Hospital in Bradford, does
   volunteer work with East African refugees and says many believe that
   the vaccine is "a way of getting rid of black people". A video that
   claimed the vaccine would be trialled on very poor people in Africa was
   shared by millions, she says.

   Giselle Rwegema is able to get through to some vaccine sceptics, but
   not all

   "What they're saying is that people go to hospital, and they don't come
   back. I work in healthcare and I know it's not true, it's just trying
   to convey that to people. Some understand it, but there are still
   others that are still not getting it." A young mother in Giselle's
   group, Corrine, is adamant that she won't take a vaccine even if it has
   been declared safe and effective: "No, definitely not. Because
   obviously, me being black and everything that we know about the work
   that's going on to just take a black number down - that's been going on
   for years and I wouldn't take it just based on that, because there are
   so many things that will be hidden in the vaccine."

'What lethal injection did you give him?'

   Accident and Emergency ward sister Emma Clinton describes an Asian man
   in his early 60s who was afraid to come into hospital, and was already
   dying by the time his family called an ambulance. "He died in the
   department within about an hour. And then of course the family were
   absolutely distraught. The son was saying, 'What lethal injection did
   you give him? How has he died? Have you killed him?'" As A&E consultant
   David Greenhorn says, once that question has been asked, it's
   impossible to turn the situation around. "If they must mistrust you
   enough to ask you that question directly, then the trust has already
   gone and you don't have the time to spend to develop it. You could
   never rebuild things, there's no way of building that bridge."

   Previously I thought that everybody would want a vaccine if we can show
   that it works, but now I fear I underestimated how suspicious people
   are. I'm not sure what we can do about it, but part of it is about
   trying to understand the reasons for these views.

   Rather than just shouting from the hospital, "It's OK, everything's
   fine," we need to understand where these rumours and false news stories
   are coming from, then we must work out how to counteract them. And I
   think that's a long-term journey.

   One plan we've had is to get some of our Covid patients, who have
   already had good experiences in hospital, to be ambassadors - patients
   from the communities that are most suspicious. That work has already
   begun in pre-publicity for the vaccine trials.
