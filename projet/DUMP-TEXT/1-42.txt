         Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook will not remove anti-vaxxer content

   People should be allowed to say they're 'worried' about getting jabs,
   says the social media giant's founder

   By Mike Wright 10 September 2020 • 5:14pm

   founder of Facebook Inc. attends the Viva Tech start-up and technology
   gathering at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on May 24, 2018
   in Paris, France. The VivaTech exhibition in Paris brings together

   Facebook won’t remove anti-vaxxer content because people should be
   allowed to say they are “worried” about getting jabs, Mark Zuckerberg
   has said.

   The founder and CEO of the social media giant said he doesn’t plan to
   shift his company’s lenient stance on vaccine conspiracies when one is
   found for Covid-19.

   However, Mr Zuckerberg’s comments prompted condemnation from UK MPs,
   who described his stance as “terrifying” and said it risked giving
   “further oxygen to deadly” vaccine fake news.

   Facebook has come under increasing pressure since the outbreak of the
   pandemic over the rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories
   surrounding vaccinations on its platform.

   In an interview with the US website Axios, Mr Zuckerberg said that
   Facebook took down any health misinformation that it deemed could cause
   an ‘imminent risk of harm’.

   However, he said he felt people should be able to question the
   effectiveness of vaccines, or express doubts about how they were being
   administered.

   The 36-year-old added: “I think that if someone is pointing out a case
   where a vaccine caused harm or that they are worried about, then it's a
   difficult thing to say, from my perspective, that you shouldn’t be
   allowed to express that at all.”

   Concern has been growing in the UK over the prevalence of social media
   vaccine conspiracies and their ability to undermine take-up when one is
   eventually rolled out for coronavirus.

   In July, Health Secretary Matt Hancock met with Sir Nick Clegg, now
   Facebook’s vice president of global affairs and communications, over
   the social media giant’s approach to anti-vaccine fake news, after
   warning in the House of Commons that “people who propagate untrue myths
   about vaccines are putting lives at risk”.

   Responding to the Facebook boss’s latest comments, Chris Elmore MP, the
   chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Media, told the
   Telegraph: “Mark Zuckerberg's comments risk giving further oxygen to
   the deadly, orchestrated, and ill-foundered anti-vax misinformation
   circulating on his platform.

   “As so often, instead of leadership and action, Mr Zuckerberg is
   offering qualification and prevarication. If he does so because of
   financial concerns, that is shameful; if he does so because he believes
   it, it’s terrifying.”

   "We are facing a crisis to which the only solution is a clinically safe
   and effective vaccine.”
