The YouTubers who blew the whistle on an anti-vax plot

   is coloured in red.

   A mysterious marketing agency secretly offered to pay social media
   stars to spread disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. Their plan
   failed when the influencers went public about the attempt to recruit
   them.

   "It started with an email" says Mirko Drotschmann, a German YouTuber
   and journalist.

   Mirko normally ignores offers from brands asking him to advertise their
   products to his more than 1.5 million subscribers. But the sponsorship
   offer he received in May this year was unlike any other.

   An influencer marketing agency called Fazze offered to pay him to
   promote what it said was leaked information that suggested the death
   rate among people who had the Pfizer vaccine was almost three times
   that of the AstraZeneca jab.

   The information provided wasn't true.

   It quickly became apparent to Mirko that he was being asked to spread
   disinformation to undermine public confidence in vaccines in the middle
   of a pandemic.

   "I was shocked," says Mirko "then I was curious, what's behind all
   that?"

   In France, science YouTuber Léo Grasset received a similar offer. The
   agency offered him 2000 euros if he would take part. Fazze said it was
   acting for a client who wished to remain anonymous.

   "That's a huge red flag" says Léo.

   Both Léo and Mirko were appalled by the false claims.

   They pretended to be interested in order to try to find out more and
   were provided with detailed instructions about what they should say in
   their videos.

   In stilted English, the brief instructed them to "Act like you have the
   passion and interest in this topic."

   It told them not to mention the video had a sponsor - and instead
   pretend they were spontaneously giving advice out of concern for their
   viewers.

   Social media platforms have rules that ban not disclosing that content
   is sponsored. In France and Germany it's also illegal.

   Fazze's brief told influencers to share a story in French newspaper Le
   Monde about a data leak from the European Medicines Agency.

   The story was genuine, but didn't include anything about vaccine
   deaths. But in this context it would give the false impression that the
   death rate statistics had come from the leak.

   The data the influencers were asked to share had actually been cobbled
   together from different sources and taken out of context.

   It presented the numbers of people who had died in several countries
   some time after receiving different Covid vaccines. But just because
   someone dies after having a vaccine doesn't mean they died because they
   had the vaccine. They could have been killed in a car accident.

   In the countries the statistics were from, greater numbers of people
   had received the Pfizer vaccine at that time, so a higher number of
   people dying after having a Pfizer jab was to be expected.

   "If you don't have any scientific training, you could just say, 'oh,
   there are these numbers, they are really different. So there must be a
   link.' But you can make any spurious correlation as you want really,"
   Léo says.

   The influencers were also provided with a list of links to share -
   dubious articles which all used the same set of figures that supposedly
   showed the Pfzer vaccine was dangerous.

   When Léo and Mirko exposed the Fazze campaign on Twitter all the
   articles, except the Le Monde story, disappeared from the web.

     C'est étrange.
     J'ai reçu une proposition de partenariat qui consiste à déglinguer
     le vaccin Pfizer en vidéo. Budget colossal, client qui veut rester
     incognito et il faut cacher la sponso.

   By any measure the disinformation campaign was bungled.

   Since Léo and Mirko blew the whistle at least four other influencers in
   France and Germany have gone public to reveal they also rejected
   Fazze's attempts to recruit them.

   But German journalist, Daniel Laufer, has identified two influencers
   who may have taken up the offer.

   Indian YouTuber Ashkar Techy usually makes jokey videos about cars and
   dating and Brazilian prankster Everson Zoio, has more than three
   million Instagram followers.

   Each of them posted uncharacteristic videos in which they pushed the
   same message as the Fazze campaign and shared the fake news links from
   the agency's brief. Both had also participated in previous Fazze
   promotions.

   After Daniel Laufer contacted them, Everson Zoio and Ashkar Techy
   removed their videos but didn't answer his questions. The BBC tried to
   contact both influencers, but they didn't respond.

   article he was asked to share. The article reads “Would you like to die
   because of COVID19 or vaccine? - Pfizer will help you with making a
   choice - AstraZeneca published a report in which Pfizer hits mortality
   records in vaccinated people.” Below the title is a table with data and

   We tried emailing the people who approached Mirko and Léo. The emails
   bounced back, not from Fazze, but from the domain of a company called
   AdNow.

   Fazze is a part of AdNow, which is a digital marketing company,
   registered in both Russia and the UK.

   The BBC has made multiple attempts to contact AdNow by phone, email and
   even a letter couriered to their Moscow headquarters, but they have not
   responded.

   Eventually we managed to contact Ewan Tolladay, one of two directors of
   the British arm of AdNow - who lives in Durham.

   Mr Tolladay said he had very little to do with Fazze - which he said
   was a joint venture between his fellow director - a Russian man called
   Stanislav Fesenko - and another person whose identity he didn't know.

   He said that he hadn't been a part of the disinformation campaign. He
   said he hadn't even known Fazze had taken on the contract before the
   story broke. He couldn't enlighten us on who the mystery client was.

   He said that in light of the scandal "we are doing the responsible
   thing and shutting down AdNow here in the UK". He said Fazze was also
   being shut down.

   We have tried to get Mr Fesenko to talk to us but had no success.

   Both the French and German authorities have launched investigations
   into Fazze's approaches to influencers.

   But the identity of the agency's mystery client remains unclear.

   There has been speculation about the Russian connections to this
   scandal and the interests of the Russian state in promoting its own
   vaccine - Sputnik V.

   Omid Nouripour, the foreign policy spokesman for the German Green party
   has suggested looking to Moscow for the motivation behind the Fazze
   campaign.

   He said: "Bad-mouthing vaccines in the West undermines trust in our
   democracies and is supposed to increase trust in Russia's vaccines, and
   there is only one side that benefits and that is the Kremlin."

   But in a statement the Russian embassy in London said: "We treat
   Covid-19 as a global threat and, thus, are not interested in
   undermining global efforts in the fight against it, with vaccinating
   people with the Pfizer vaccine as one of the ways to cope with the
   virus."

   While Fazze's campaign was a flop, Léo Grasset believes it won't be the
   last attempt to use the power of social influencers to spread
   disinformation.

   "If you want to manipulate public opinion, especially for young people,
   you don't go to TV" says French YouTuber Léo Grasset.

   "Just spend the same money on TikTok creators, YouTube creators. The
   whole ecosystem is perfectly built for maximum efficiency of
   disinformation right now."
