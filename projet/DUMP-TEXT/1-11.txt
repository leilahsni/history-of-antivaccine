   Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic
   this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday.

1. Call to get Covid vaccines before winter

   Unvaccinated people in England have been asked to get their Covid-19
   vaccine before winter. NHS bosses are urging any of the 4.5 million
   people in England who haven't had a first vaccine dose to come forward
   and get one. Having a jab will protect you and your families at
   Christmas, said NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard. You can
   read more about the UK's vaccine rollout here.

2. US border reopens to UK travellers

   UK visitors are now able to travel to the US for the first time in
   nearly two years. Prior to this morning, only US citizens, residents
   and other exempt groups had been allowed entry to the US from the UK.
   All UK travellers over 18 will be asked to provide proof of vaccination
   to enter the US, which has also reopened its borders to people from
   Brazil, China, India, Ireland, South Africa, Iran and the Schengen
   countries.

3. Anti-vax protests outside UK schools

   The BBC has been told of bullying and harassment by anti-vaccination
   campaigners outside some schools in the UK. There are now calls for
   schools to be able to employ fast track exclusion zones to tackle the
   problem. Peter Kyle, the shadow education minister, said such incidents
   are "ubiquitous" in his constituency, Hove.

4. Concern over elderly missing booster jab

   Doctors say they're "very concerned" about the number of elderly people
   who haven't had a Covid-19 booster jab. About 20% of over 80s in the
   North East and north Cumbria who had their two earlier vaccinations
   still haven't taken up the offer of a booster. Dr Stewart Findley, who
   is heading the vaccination programme in the region, says it means some
   of the most vulnerable people are now at greater risk.

5. Remorse over pandemic purchases

   One in 10 people have expressed their regret over buying items ranging
   from DIY tools and pizza ovens to hot tubs and garden furniture during
   the pandemic, according to a survey. The sales of some items that
   people could enjoy at home surged during Covid lockdowns. But Insurer
   Aviva said many expensive items were now gathering dust.
