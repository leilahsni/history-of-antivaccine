Anti-vax ‘vigilantes’ urge Covid patients to avoid hospitals and try home
cures

   ‘Vigilante medicine’, where traditional medicine is shunned in favour
   of bizarre online advice, is spreading

   Two hosts of ‘The View’ test positive for Covid-19 ahead of interview
   with Kamala Harris
   Leer en Español

   Anti-vax groups are telling Covid patients to avoid hospitals and
   extract sick family members from intensive care units, as part of an
   intensifying disinformation campaign being spread via Facebook and
   encrypted messaging apps.

   The groups are fuelling conspiracy theories that doctors are stopping
   unvaccinated patients from receiving supposed miracle cures such as
   ivermectin or even deliberately trying to harm them, according to posts
   viewed by NBC News.

   Doctors treating Covid patients say they are increasingly having to
   deal with assaults and threats of violence from anti-vaxxers, with
   incidents reported in Texas, Georgia, Idaho and Massachusetts in recent
   weeks.

   According to posts viewed by NBC News, members of anti-vax Facebook
   groups are offering instructions on how to get family members removed
   from hospital by insisting they be transferred to hospice care, and
   have recorded videos of apparently successful extractions that have
   later gone viral.

   They convince members the only way to treat patients suffering from
   severe Covi symptoms is to self-medicate with ivermectin, a horse
   dewormer which has become popular in anti-vax circles.

   When that doesn’t work they recommend potentially even more dangerous
   treatments such as gargling iodine or taking hydrogen peroxide, forcing
   the the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America to warn against
   nebulising or inhaling the chemical earlier this week.

     DO NOT put hydrogen peroxide into your nebulizer and breathe it in.
     This is dangerous. It is not a way to prevent nor treat COVID-19.

   The more dangerous at-home treatments are part of what anti-vaxxers
   call the “protocol”, which is being shared through Facebook and on the
   encrypted messaging app Telegram.

   The practice of pushing unproven treatments at home rather than get the
   Covid vaccine or seek medical misinformation is being described as
   “vigilante medicine” by Harvard Medical School physician Aditi
   Nerurkar.

   Dr Nerurkar described “vigilante medicine” as “medicine being practised
   by laypeople who are reading groups created by other laypeople in echo
   chambers and silos that, likely, someone in the anti-vax movement is
   profiting from.

   Doctors are increasingly fearful for their safety after a wave of
   violent incidents reported in intensive care units across the US.

   A nurse in Newton, Massachusetts, told WHDH an out-of-control patient
   tried to gouge her eye out with his key. She said she was suffering
   from post-traumatic stress disorder from dealing with violent Covid
   patients.

   In a separate incident at the same hospital, five nurses were attacked
   by one patient.

   In San Antonio, Texas, staff have been “cursed at, screamed at,
   threatened with bodily harm and even had knives pulled on them”, Jane
   McCurley, chief nursing executive for Methodist Healthcare System, told
   a press conference last week.

   Doctors in Boise, Idaho, called police after the family member of a
   Covid patient threatened staff after they refused to treat the man with
   ivermectin.

   Social media companies have attempted to crack down on Covid
   misinformation being spread on their platforms, but anti-vax groups are
   getting around the restrictions by using innocuous-sounding codewords
   such as “dance parties”.
