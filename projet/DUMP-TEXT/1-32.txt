Why are some footballers vaccine hesitant & what happens next?

   By Katie FalkinghamBBC Sport

   does not want to be vaccinated

   Football managers, the Premier League, governing bodies and even
   politicians are weighing in on the issue of players being vaccinated
   against coronavirus.

   On Tuesday, Republic of Ireland and West Brom forward Callum Robinson
   said he would not be vaccinated - despite having had Covid-19 twice.

   So with fewer than half of players at most Premier League and English
   Football League clubs vaccinated, why might some players be hesitant
   and how could that impact football?

   BBC Sport looks into the issue.

Rewards, red-list countries and role models

   Football authorities want players to be double vaccinated, with the
   Premier League considering whether to "reward" clubs whose coronavirus
   vaccination rates are high.

   As of two weeks ago, the squads of only seven clubs in the top flight
   were more than 50% fully vaccinated.

   One of those is Wolves, who confirmed to BBC Sport that, since July,
   100% of their first team players and staff have been fully vaccinated.

   Last week, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said "99%" of his players had
   been vaccinated and that he did not understand the hesitancy of some.

   In Scotland, BBC Sport understands all but four members of the national
   squad and backroom staff have received two doses of the vaccine.

   In the English Football League, meanwhile, the BBC understands that, as
   of September, 49% of players are fully vaccinated - up from only 18%
   the previous month.

   Other Premier League managers have previously called on their players
   to get immunised, including Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta, Nuno Espirito
   Santo, Steve Bruce and Graham Potter.

   "When all the scientists, all the doctors, all the big specialists
   about medicine say the only solution to eradicate or help to move
   forward after this two years of pandemic situation is being vaccinated,
   I think they should consider it," said Manchester City boss Guardiola,
   whose mother died after contracting coronavirus in April 2020.

   If further incentive is needed, it was announced that Premier League
   players are only allowed to travel to UK-designated 'red-list' nations,
   such as Brazil, to represent their countries in this month's World Cup
   qualifiers if they are fully vaccinated.

   However - and contrary to some media reports - BBC Sport understands
   Fifa does not want any player to be prevented from playing in the Qatar
   2022 World Cup because of their vaccination status, and is looking into
   alternatives to being fully vaccinated, including proof of recovery
   from Covid-19 or negative tests.

   Meanwhile, Health Secretary Sajid Javid - reacting to reports several
   England squad members had refused to be vaccinated - said it was
   "disappointing".

   "They are role models in society. People, especially young people, I
   think will look up to them and they should recognise that, and the
   difference that can make in terms of encouraging others," Javid said.

   On Wednesday England players Fikayo Tomori, Tammy Abraham and Jesse
   Lingard were asked about their stance on vaccines and all three
   stressed that it was a personal choice.

   Tomori did not reveal his vaccination status, saying: "We're public
   figures, in the public eye, so I definitely see why people are
   wondering or asking, 'If they're going to take it, I'm going to take
   it', 'If they're not going to take it, I'm not going to take it'.

   "I don't think it's my place to put it out there if I've done this or
   done that to influence people. It's to leave people to their own if
   they want to do it or not."
     * The Sports Desk: Should sport get tough on vaccine hesitancy?

   Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow is one player who has publicly called
   on fellow footballers to get the vaccine, after he was hospitalised
   with Covid-19 in July.

   Speaking to BBC Sport in September, Darlow - having only just returned
   to full fitness after "awful fatigue" and losing five kilograms in
   weight - said his experience had convinced "a couple" of his team-mates
   to get immunised.

   He added that "four or five" other Newcastle players remained
   unvaccinated "for hopefully genuine reasons".

   But vaccination remains the player's personal choice - so what could
   those reasons be?

Misinformation, complacency and WhatsApp groups

   In the UK, almost 49 million people have received a first dose of a
   Covid-19 vaccine, while almost 45 million have received a second - an
   uptake of 89.8% and 82.5% of over-16s respectively.

   However, some people choose not to be vaccinated, citing a number of
   factors, including their lack of confidence in the vaccine, concerns
   about side-effects, or a fear of needles.

   Others - a minority - opt out of vaccination because of their
   consumption of misinformation and conspiracy theories online,
   particularly on social media.

   This has affected the uptake among footballers too.

   In September, the Times reported that players had been sharing
   misinformation on WhatsApp groups, with PFA chief executive Maheta
   Molango urging them to not "believe all the myths and lies" online.

   All players have received guidance from deputy chief medical officer
   Professor Jonathan van Tam, including a myth-busting video, and Boston
   United fan Van Tam also held a briefing with Premier League captains
   last month.

   Those messages were echoed by Rochdale club doctor Wesley Tensel, who
   told BBC 5 Live Breakfast on Tuesday that vaccination rates at the
   League One club were "very poor".

   "I think one of the reasons is social media, the anti-vax stuff that's
   bandied around, and it does get passed around the changing room," he
   said.

   "Football changing rooms are different to most workplaces. They're all
   together, it's an echo chamber, so if one of the senior players or an
   influential person has seen something on social media and that's passed
   to somebody else, they're not necessarily likely to critically appraise
   where that's come from and they can end up going down a rabbit hole."

   Tensel is also a GP and is the clinical lead at a local vaccination
   centre. He says he messages the players when there is a clinic open but
   "it's got to the point now where nobody replies."

   For West Brom forward Robinson, the decision not to get vaccinated is,
   he says, "my choice at this moment in time".

   "It's obviously annoying that I've caught it twice but I haven't been
   vaccinated," he said. "Further down the line I could change my mind and
   want to do it."

   His Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny said: "There are a lot of
   myths and a lot of issues around virility that people are concerned
   about and other issues, and I do think it is complex. I am not a
   medical expert, but I do trust the experts and I do think it is better
   to be double-vaccinated."

   Leeds United and Northern Ireland midfielder Stuart Dallas, who is
   double vaccinated, said nobody "can be forced into doing anything", but
   that he chose to get the vaccine "to get back to normality as soon as I
   could".

   Another reason players are opting out could be complacency - infection
   rates in Premier League footballers this season are low.

   Last week, the latest two rounds of lateral flow testing found four new
   positive cases among 2,927 players and staff at top-flight clubs

   This figure has been in single digits each week since the week
   commencing 23 August. If so few players are catching coronavirus, why
   is vaccination an issue?

   "These players are obviously young and fit so from one aspect I can
   understand why they may feel that its not necessary to be vaccinated,"
   said Tensel.

   "I've spoken to some of the senior players just to get their point of
   view as to why they think the uptake is low, and some of the responses
   are they don't want to feel unwell if they get the jab which may affect
   their performance.

   "But obviously on the other hand if they were to get Covid, which quite
   a few of our players have had over the last year, they've been out for
   10 days and felt really unwell so I don't think that argument really
   stacks up."

What could happen next?

   So what does football do about it?

   The numbers are slowly improving, and while just shy of half of EFL
   players are fully vaccinated, the league says 75% have had one dose,
   two doses, or intend to get the vaccine. That is up from 70% in August.

   The EFL says it is actively working with the NHS to provide for mobile
   vaccine clinics at clubs, while in the Premier League, BBC Sport
   understands clubs are continuing to speak to their players to encourage
   them to get the vaccine.

   The government also continues to work closely with clubs in a bid to
   increase vaccine uptake.

   However, Republic of Ireland boss Kenny thinks it would be "quite
   radical" if players were not selected for overseas games on the basis
   of their vaccination status.

   So perhaps football needs to look to other sports and their approach?

   In rugby union, Saracens have reportedly made face masks and social
   distancing optional after hitting an 85% vaccination target.

   But in US basketball's NBA, a tougher approach to protocols means
   unvaccinated players are being tested more and kept as far away as
   possible from those who are vaccinated where feasible.

   They are also banned from "higher-risk settings", including restaurants
   and other entertainment venues.

   Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins had his request for
   religious exemption from the Covid-19 vaccine rejected by the NBA,
   which said he could not play in any home games until he met San
   Francisco's health requirements on attending large indoor events -
   including elite athletes. He subsequently chose to have the vaccine.
