    The Dutch Coronacheck app is not checked everywhere  the BBC  s Anna 
    Holligan has found 

    There have been protests and complaints of restricted freedom  but much 
    of Europe is now using Covid passports to enter bars  restaurants  
    cinemas and museums  

    Italy also requires a Covid pass to enter a workplace and Austria is 
    about to follow suit  

    Although England does not require a pass  from Friday  the UK  s digital 
    Covid pass will be accepted across the European Union  

    Our correspondents around Europe have been getting to grips with the 
    rules  
    Banner 

    Italy has adopted arguably the most rigid Covid pass rules in Europe  
    writes Mark Lowen in Rome  The Green Pass QR code  from at least one 
    Covid vaccination  negative test or proof of recovery  has to be shown 
    for everything from indoor restaurants to cinemas  gyms and intercity 
    trains  It is also required by all employees in the public and private 
    sectors when they turn up for work  Passes are checked regularly and my 
    family  visiting from the UK  were amazed how rigidly Covid rules  
    including masks  are respected here  

    In France it is surprising how quickly the passe sanitaire has become 
    part of daily life  writes Hugh Schofield in Paris  Few think twice now 
    before presenting their mobile phones at bars  cinemas and museums  or 
    on TGV trains and at airports  It is a normalised ritual  
    Hugh with corona pass 
    Image caption

    It  s a different story in the Netherlands  writes Anna Holligan  In all 
    the beach bars  restaurants and city cafes I  ve visited since the pass 
    was introduced on 25 September  I have not once been asked to flash my 
    pass  although I have been asked at the cinema  The rules state anyone 
    aged 13 and over has to show a Covid entry pass  although not for shops 
    or taking part in sports events  

    Denmark actually phased out its coronapas last month  writes Adrienne 
    Murray in Copenhagen  It was first in Europe to adopt a pass in April 
    but has now downgraded Covid  19 to a no longer  socially critical  
    disease  

    In Germany  if you go out to eat or drink  it  s good to know the latest 
    Covid regulation lingo  writes Damien McGuinness in Berlin  Handmade 
    signs with a large 2 G have popped up on the doors of many restaurants  
    cafes and bars  2 G means only people who are either geimpft 
     vaccinated  or genesen  recovered  can go in  No sign means the usual 
    3 G rule applies  which includes negative tests too  

    Austrians have used 3 G certificates for months  writes Bethany Bell in 
    Vienna  A friend and I went recently to one of my favourite restaurants 
    in Vienna  which serves excellent Wiener Schnitzel and apple strudel  
     You have your Green Passes  I suppose  asked the waiter suspiciously  
    He glanced briefly at our digital certificates  then handed over the 
    menus  Some establishments check on the passes very strictly  others 
    don  t even bother to ask  

    In Switzerland  Covid passes are obligatory and the rules strictly 
    applied  says Imogen Foulkes in Bern  And now that Covid tests aren  t 
    free anymore  going out for a beer gets pretty expensive  The 
    vaccination rate is stagnating at around 62 and the government wants 
    more people to get the jab  
    Banner 

    Anna Holligan  After some early consternation  the majority of 
    pragmatic Dutch accepted the pass as a means of resurrecting their 
    social lives while shrugging off social distancing  When I  ve asked 
    waiters or box  office workers if they want to see the QR code proving 
    my vaccination the answers vary from  no  it  s okay  we trust you  to 
     we don  t actually have the technology  A recent study by I  O Research 
    found around a third of cafes and restaurants in the Netherlands were 
    not scanning the coronapasses  

    Adrienne Murray  Danes are tech  savvy and accepted the app quickly as 
    it offered a quick path out of lockdown  But because the coronapas came 
    in well before people were double  vaccinated it required regular 
    testing  Free test centres sprung up in neighbourhoods all over 
    Copenhagen and towns elsewhere  These have mostly closed now that 75 
    of over  12 s are fully vaccinated and a third booster is being rolled 
    out

    Guy Delauney says lip  service is often paid to the Covid passes in 
    Balkan countries 

    Guy Delauney  Balkans correspondent  I  ve detected little enthusiasm 
    for the passes  travelling through Slovenia  Croatia  Serbia and North 
    Macedonia  While one restaurant on the main square in the Macedonian 
    capital Skopje barred entry to people without passes  another had no 
    checks at all  Staff complain of abuse  so a sign or a sticker on a 
    table often acts as a fig leaf for official policies  
    Banner 

    Mark Lowen  There  s a stereotype of Italians as a nation not minded to 
    follow rules  but by being hit first in Europe  the pandemic seems to 
    have changed that  and Italy  s  no  vax  movement is relatively small  
    Dockers hold a banner reading  No Green Pass  no discrimination

    Dockers in Trieste have been among the most vocal protesters against 
    having the Covid pass compulsory at work 

    There have been some protests  Crowds stormed and smashed up a trade 
    union building and then anti  Green Pass workers staged sit  ins and 
    protests in Trieste  blockading the country  s most important commercial 
    port  Police broke them up with tear gas and water cannon  

    Imogen Foulkes  Opponents of the Swiss pass complain the strict 
    policies undermine their constitutional freedoms  There are 
    demonstrations every week  some of which have turned violent  Enough 
    signatures have been gathered to call a referendum on 28 November to 
    abolish the passes  If the Swiss do vote to get rid of them  it could 
    make travel in Europe problematic  as the Swiss pass is recognised 
    across Europe  s passport  free Schengen area  

    Hugh Schofield  Of course there are people in France who object on 
    principle to having to prove their credentials at every turn  Every 
    Saturday there are demonstrations in Paris and other cities  bringing 
    together anti  vaxxers with libertarians and protesters against  health 
    discrimination  Contrary to what some expected  though  these have not 
    turned into a mass movement  and are dwindling in strength  

    Anna Holligan  There have been a few challenges in the Netherlands  one 
    failed lawsuit argued the pass was discriminatory because it treated 
    unvaccinated people differently without good reason  Supermodel Doutzen 
    Kroes announced on Instagram that she would not be  forced to take the 
    shot  or  forced to prove my health to participate in society  But 
    opposition to the pass in the Netherlands appears to be more a matter 
    of principle than practicality  

    Bethany Bell  While many Austrians welcomed the passes as a step 
    towards more freedoms  the opposition far  right Freedom Party has 
    championed those who disagree with the measures  Its head  Herbert 
    Kickl  has accused the government of splitting society into  the good 
    vaccinated and the bad unvaccinated  

    Guy Delauney  There have been protests in Slovenia  s capital every 
    Wednesday in recent weeks and some have involved violent confrontations 
    with the police  who have used teargas and water cannon to clear the 
    crowds

    Slovenian protesters have challenged restrictions regularly in the 
    capital Ljubljana 

    Serbian protesters have also been making themselves heard in Belgrade 
    in recent days  despite the fact that the Covid pass there only 
    applies to bars and restaurants after 2200  One epidemiologist 
    described that approach as  trying to put out a fire with a glass of 
    water  

    Adrienne Murray  Denmark  s coronapas was agreed across all 
    parliamentary parties  even the opposition  with the promise that it 
    would only be used for a finite time  And it was  Some public protests 
    were held but they were attended by hundreds not thousands

    Hugh Schofield  The effect of the French passe sanitaire on levels of 
    vaccination seems incontrovertible  From the beginning of August 
    vaccinations shot up  Clearly many who were hesitating decided for the 
    sake of a return to normal  ish life  it was necessary to take the 
    plunge  Today 50 million French people have been totally vaccinated  
    including 884 of over  12 s  And since mid  October a second part of the 
    national arm  twist has come into effect  the end of free tests  The 
    passe sanitaire has two options  either show proof of vaccination or a 
    recent negative test  With this second option now incurring a cost  
    there  ll be a further incentive for vaccination  

    Damien McGuinness  Germany has also dropped free antigen tests under 
    its 3 G rule  so anyone eligible who refuses the vaccine has to pay  
    Businesses can now choose for themselves whether to allow unvaccinated 
    customers inside and this 2 G rule is seen as a way of encouraging 
    vaccination  It can be a selling point for customers  One Berlin 
    cafe  owner said he had only had one objection from a regular   I just 
    replied that he had excluded himself by deciding to not get 
    vaccinated  he told me  
    Mark Lowen in Rome with coffee 
    Image caption  
    Covid rules are broadly followed in Italy  Mark Lowen says his 
    eight  year  old niece was expected to wear a mask in cafes  shops and 
    museums 

    Mark Lowen  Nothing motivates an Italian like threatening to bar them 
    from their favourite trattoria and when compulsory passes were 
    announced there was a sudden spike in vaccination appointments  Italy 
    has some of the highest vaccination rates in Europe  with around 82 
    having received both doses  but that rate has slowed slightly and 40 
    of the workers at Trieste port still haven  t been vaccinated  while 
    far  right parties have courted the anti  vax and anti  Green Pass 
    movement  

    Guy Delauney  Slovenia has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the 
    EU  and its efforts to implement a Covid pass system initially helped 
    boost take  up  That was until the constitutional court suspended a 
    mandatory pass for public sector workers  Shops and restaurants all 
    display notices reminding customers they need a valid PCT certificate  
    as it is known  But enforcement is patchy and official inspectors are 
    thin on the ground

    Mark Lowen  They  ll certainly stay in Italy until the end of the year  
    but possibly in a nod to the protest movement the deputy health 
    minister has said they could be  reassessed  next year if the data 
    continues to show manageable infection numbers  low hospitalisations  
    and rising vaccine rates  The government says the alternative to 
    compulsory passes is new restrictions  and most Italians will do 
    whatever they can to avoid another lockdown  

    Adrienne Murray  The passes in Denmark may have gone but Covid is still 
    here  Cases have recently risen back above 1000 a day and are expected 
    to go up further  However  there is little trace of the pandemic in 
    everyday life  just the hand gel at the entrance to the supermarket  
    There  s no social distancing  it  s rare to see anyone in a face mask 
    and guidance to work from home lifted in early August  

    Bethany Bell  As of 1 November  Austrians will have to show 3 G passes 
    to go to work  And this winter they will also have to show the 
    certificates if they want to go skiing  Passes will be checked when 
    people buy tickets for the ski lifts  And there are even stricter plans 
    for apr è s  ski  where antigen tests will no longer be accepted  only a 
    vaccination certificate  proof of recovery or negative PCR test result 
    will do  

    Hugh Schofield  The initial hope was that the passe sanitaire could be 
    phased out in France from mid  November  That is not going to happen  
    The government is warning that though the Covid situation is vastly 
    improved from two months ago  there are still risks of a winter 
    resurgence  Last week a new health bill passed its first reading in 
    parliament  which would make possible an extension of the passe until 
    July 2022  

    Guy Delauney  Coronavirus case numbers have been surging across the 
    Western Balkans  so despite the poor response to Covid passes  
    governments are likely to try again
