    Just as the Covid  19 vaccine rollout began in earnest in the United 
    States  the Informed Consent Action Network  Ican  sent its subscribers 
    a  legal update  on its war against employers and schools planning to 
    require the shots  

    An unspecified number of organizations had supposedly dropped their 
    mandates – one just after Ican took them to court – and the Texas  based 
    anti  vaccination nonprofit was prowling for more plaintiffs  

     If you or anyone you know is being required by an employer or school 
    to receive a Covid  19 vaccine  Ican is pleased to offer to support 
    legal action on your behalf to challenge the requirement   read the 
    January email  

    Ican was founded in 2016 by one of the loudest voices in the US 
    anti  vaccine movement  Del Bigtree  who produced the widely discredited 
    propaganda movie Vaxxed  From Cover  Up to Catastrophe  For the last 
    year  the nonprofit has capitalized on fear surrounding supposed 
    vaccine mandates  going on the offensive months before any lifesaving 
    vaccines became available to the public  Now  as vaccine hesitancy 
    persists  Ican  s legal blitz has fueled disinformation  using costly 
    legal threats to deter schools and businesses from implementing 
    vaccination requirements  

     If you have a limited budget to deal with litigation  it doesn  t 
    matter if you might win at the supreme court level   said Margaret 
    Foster Riley  a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law  
     The costs of that litigation are so existentially threatening that 
    you  re not going to take the risk   

    Ican did not return the Guardian  s request for comment  

    The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has already given the 
    go  ahead to employers who want to require vaccines for employees in the 
    workplace  according to recent guidance  However  the idea of a 
     vaccine mandate  is misleading  as students and workers still have the 
    right to refuse a jab and won  t be involuntarily vaccinated  said Y 
    Tony Yang  a professor of health policy at George Washington 
    University  

    Those who forgo a shot may be barred from some opportunities  although 
    there  s still the possibility of waivers  exemptions and other 
    work  arounds  Plus  they  ll likely have the ability to choose education 
    or employment alternatives that don  t require vaccines  

     Sure  that  s a different school  might not be the school you want   
    Yang said   That  s the option   

    Vaccine requirements are already commonplace in academic settings and 
    among healthcare workers in the US  But the specter of Covid  19 vaccine 
    mandates nevertheless became a  calling card  for anti  vax groups like 
    Ican – a lightning rod to  rally people  and  sow a lot of 
    contentiousness   said Rekha Lakshmanan  director of advocacy and 
    public policy at the Immunization Partnership  

     There  s a theme of being very pre  emptive and opportunistic to sort of 
    lay this foundation and seeds of doubt   Lakshmanan said  

    In fact  Ican may have targeted mandates so strongly because the 
    Covid  19 vaccine – which has already reached more than 65 of US adults 
    – represents  an existential threat  to its mission  Riley said  

     The more used to vaccination people are – and this is a 
    population  wide experience – the less traction Ican has as an anti  vax 
    organization   she added  

    If the anti  vax movement is a pyramid scheme  Ican sits at the top 
    among the well  funded organizers and creators of misinformation  
    explained Dorit Reiss  a professor at the University of California  
    Hastings College of the Law  

    Some of the nonprofit  s staff may be  true believers   Reiss allowed  
    But as a whole  the institution is largely  cynical  and 
     manipulative   far removed from the grassroots activists who act as 
    door  to  door salesmen  spreading misinformation to friends and 
    neighbors  

    Since Ican  s inception  its leaders have attracted a substantial fan 
    base through its pseudo  talk show hosted by Bigtree  established a 
    strong relationship with the New York  based attorney Aaron Siri and 
    fundraised millions for their mission  

     They are much better at promoting their message comparatively than 
    many of the organizations that are in the public health space   said 
    Ana Santos Rutschman  an assistant professor at the Saint Louis 
    University School of Law  

     They have resources directed at them  They are savvier   

    The nonprofit has made a home in Texas  where deeply rooted 
    conservative beliefs around liberty and freedom have sprouted an 
    active  sizable anti  vax community  including a political action 
    committee that advocates for  vaccine choice   

    Earlier this month  a federal judge in Texas dismissed a lawsuit 
    brought by employees of Houston Methodist hospital who had challenged 
    the hospital  s Covid  19 vaccination requirement  in one of the first 
    rulings of its kind  The hospital suspended 178 staff for refusing the 
    shot  which some have described as  venom   

     The political environment here was unfortunately prime and ripe for 
    individuals and organizations like Ican to kind of set up shop in 
    Texas   Lakshmanan said  

    Ican  s tactics and reliance on expensive legal services predate the 
    pandemic  but threats of litigation became central to its strategy as 
    it took on Covid  19 vaccine requirements  

    In 2019  126 m of the nonprofit  s 35 m total expenses went to Siri  s 
    law firm  Siri and Glimstad  and this year  the nonprofit described 
    Siri as its legal team leader  In February  Siri published a warning 
    that organizations with Covid  19 vaccine requirements would  run afoul 
    of the law   which could land them in court  

     Such potentially costly lawsuits can be avoided by refraining from 
    adopting policies that require vaccination or penalize members for 
    choosing not to be vaccinated   he wrote for Stat  a health  focused 
    outlet produced by Boston Globe Media  

    Siri  s incendiary op  ed focused on the vaccines  emergency use 
    authorizations  EUAs  which have allowed Americans to access the shots 
    for months even though the US Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has 
    yet to fully approve them  

    As with any products approved for emergency use  US code requires that 
    patients be informed of their choice to  accept or refuse 
    administration  of the Covid  19 vaccines  and  of the consequences  if 
    any  of refusing   

    In recent months  Siri  s firm has leaned on that provision along with 
    other  weaker claims to lodge a barrage of attacks against an eclectic 
    group of organizations requiring Covid  19 vaccinations  including New 
    Jersey universities  a Wisconsin nursing home and a North Carolina 
    sheriff  s department  the Washington Post reported  

     It  s these subliminal messages that are being issued out to entities   
    Lakshmanan said   Hey  if you  re going to even consider this  this is 
    what we  re going to do  and this is what we already started to put into 
    motion   

    But in May  Ican at least pressed pause on actively recruiting 
    plaintiffs and announced it would no longer accept cases fighting 
    vaccine requirements  Although there  s still a legal grey area around 
    mandates for EUA  authorized vaccines  experts are increasingly 
    confident that  on balance  the courts would likely uphold them  

    Meanwhile  with Pfizer  BioNTech and Moderna already applying to get 
    their vaccines fully approved by the FDA  companies and institutions 
    will likely benefit from over a century of judicial precedent defending 
    mandatory vaccinations in coming months  

    And  for employers  the prospect of a Covid  19 outbreak after a year of 
    unexpected closures may now outweigh any hypothetical litigation  

     The risk of losing the lawsuit is probably smaller  even if it means 
    that the mandate will only be in place for six months   Reiss said  
     That  s already a lot   

    Still  Ican isn  t going away  During this legislative session  Bigtree 
    testified in front of Texas lawmakers to push for a bill that would 
    have scared and confused patients  More recently  the nonprofit has 
    tried to discredit Dr Anthony Fauci after obtaining a series of his 
    emails through the Freedom of Information Act  

     They attract a lot of traffic   Santos Rutschman said   wherever they 
    decide to go
