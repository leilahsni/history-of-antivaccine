It’s shocking to see so many leftwingers lured to the far right by conspiracy
theories

   It’s not just anti-vaxxers. The themes of resisting power and regaining
   control of our lives have been cynically repurposed

   It’s an uncomfortable thing to admit, but in the countercultural
   movements where my sympathies lie, people are dropping like flies.
   Every few days I hear of another acquaintance who has become seriously
   ill with Covid, after proudly proclaiming the benefits of “natural
   immunity”, denouncing vaccines and refusing to take the precautions
   that apply to lesser mortals. Some have been hospitalised. Within these
   circles, which have for so long sought to cultivate a good society,
   there are people actively threatening the lives of others.

   It’s not just anti-vax beliefs that have been spreading through these
   movements. On an almost daily basis I see conspiracy theories
   travelling smoothly from right to left. I hear right-on people mouthing
   the claims of white supremacists, apparently in total ignorance of
   their origins. I encounter hippies who once sought to build communities
   sharing the memes of extreme individualism. Something has gone badly
   wrong in parts of the alternative scene.

   There has long been an overlap between certain new age and far-right
   ideas. The Nazis embraced astrology, pagan festivals, organic farming,
   forest conservation, ecological education and nature worship. They
   promoted homeopathy and “natural healing”, and tended to resist
   vaccination. We should be aware of this history, but without indulging
   what Simon Schama calls the “obscene syllogism”: the idea that because
   the Nazis promoted new age beliefs, alternative medicine and ecological
   protection, anyone who does so is a Nazi.

   In the 1960s and 70s, European fascists sought to reinvent themselves,
   using themes developed by revolutionary anarchists. They found fertile
   ground in parts of the anarcho-primitivist and deep ecology movements,
   which they tried to steer towards notions of “ethnic separatism” and
   “indigenous” autonomy.

   But much of what we are seeing at the moment is new. A few years ago,
   dreadlocked hippies spreading QAnon lies and muttering about a
   conspiracy against Donald Trump would have seemed unthinkable. Today,
   the old boundaries have broken down, and the most unlikely people have
   become susceptible to rightwing extremism.

   The anti-vaccine movement is a highly effective channel for the
   penetration of far-right ideas into leftwing countercultures. For
   several years, anti-vax has straddled the green left and the far right.
   Trump flirted with it, at one point inviting the anti-vaxxer Robert F
   Kennedy Jr to chair a “commission on vaccination safety and scientific
   integrity”.

   Anti-vax beliefs overlap strongly with a susceptibility to conspiracy
   theories. This tendency has been reinforced by Facebook algorithms
   directing vaccine-hesitant people towards far-right conspiracy groups.
   Ancient links between “wellness” movements and antisemitic paranoia
   have in some cases been re-established. The notion of the “sovereign
   body”, untainted by chemical contamination, has begun to fuse with the
   fear that a shadowy cabal is trying to deprive us of autonomy.

   There’s a temptation to overthink this, and we should never discount
   the role of sheer bloody idiocy. Some anti-vaxxers are now calling
   themselves “purebloods”, a term that should send a chill through anyone
   even vaguely acquainted with 20th-century history. In their defence,
   however, if they can’t even get Harry Potter right (purebloods is what
   the bad guys call themselves), we can’t expect them to detect an echo
   of the Nuremberg laws.

   I believe this synthesis of left-alternative and rightwing cultures has
   been accelerated by despondency, confusion and betrayal. After left-ish
   political parties fell into line with corporate power, the right seized
   the language they had abandoned. Steve Bannon and Dominic Cummings
   brilliantly repurposed the leftwing themes of resisting elite power and
   regaining control of our lives. Now there has been an almost perfect
   language swap. Parties that once belonged on the left talk about
   security and stability while those on the right talk of liberation and
   revolt.

   But I suspect it also has something to do with the issues we now face.
   A justified suspicion about the self-interest of big pharma clashes
   with the need for mass vaccination. The lockdowns and other measures
   required to prevent Covid-19 spreading are policies which, in other
   circumstances, would rightly be seen as coercive political control.
   Curtailing the pandemic, climate breakdown and the collapse of
   biodiversity means powerful agreements struck between governments –
   which can be hard to swallow for movements that have long fought
   multilateral power while emphasising the local and the homespun.

   So how do we navigate this? How do we remain true to our
   countercultural roots while resisting the counterculture of the right?
   There’s a sound hippy principle that we should strive to apply:
   balance.

   I don’t mean the compromised, submissive doctrine that calls itself
   centrism, which leads inexorably towards such extreme outcomes as the
   Iraq war, endless economic growth and ecological disaster. I mean the
   balance between competing values in which true radicalism is to be
   found: reason and warmth, empiricism and empathy, liberty and
   consideration. It is this balance that defends us from both co-option
   and extremism.

   While we might seek simplicity, we need also to recognise that the
   human body, human society and the natural world are phenomenally
   complex, and cannot be easily understood. Life is messy. Bodily and
   spiritual sovereignty are illusions. There is no pure essence; we are
   all mudbloods.

   Enlightenment of any kind is possible only through long and determined
   engagement with other people’s findings and other people’s ideas.
   Self-realisation requires constant self-questioning. True freedom
   emerges from respect for other people.
