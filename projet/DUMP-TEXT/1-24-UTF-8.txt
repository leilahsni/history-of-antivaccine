   It is "not acceptable" for anti-vax protesters to intimidate people
   outside Covid vaccination centres, the first minister has said.

   Mark Drakeford was speaking after a 15-year-old girl and her mum were
   confronted by protesters in Cardiff while going for a jab on Saturday.

   Grace Baker-Earle said the experience "hit a spot" as she uses a
   wheelchair since contracting Covid.

   Other parents said they felt "shaken up" by protesters.

   South Wales Police said officers attended and one arrest was made.

   Mr Drakeford said: "People are entitled to protest, people are entitled
   to express their view.

   "They're not entitled to do it in a way that intimidates others.

   "It has been lifechanging for Grace, we are hoping she will get
   better," her mother says

   "When you're talking about harassment, it's not what the person who is
   making the protests thinks about it, it's the impact that has on the
   individual.

   "Very clearly in this case, that young woman felt intimidated."

   Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement that the
   "enforcement authorities... need to be prepared to step in".

   "They are right to say that people have a right to protest and so on,
   but they need to think about it in terms of the impact that will have
   on the individual who is being, in this case, directly approached by a
   group of people."

   Grace's mother, Angela, said "it was incredibly unpleasant" experience
   when the protesters accused her of using her daughter "as a lab rat" at
   Cardiff's Bayside mass vaccination centre.

   Ms Baker-Earle, from Cowbridge, in the Vale Glamorgan, said 15
   protesters walked in front of her car and she had to tell one man to
   "step back".

   Grace had vomiting and diarrhoea for 10 days and lost half a stone
   after catching Covid-19

   "He was within two feet of me, looked at me as if I was stupid. I told
   them: 'You have literally surrounded my car'."

   She said a vaccination centre steward then came out and checked she and
   her daughter were safe.

   Meanwhile, another parent, Melissa Ringham has called for more
   protection for people entering vaccination centres.

'I didn't feel safe'

   She said her 15-year-old daughter and herself felt "shaken up" after
   being targeted by protesters yesterday at the Bayside vaccination
   centre.

   The 42-year-old mother, from Barry, said they were followed by a
   protester "walking behind us" and "wouldn't leave us be" as they walked
   up to the vaccination centre entrance.

   "He got into my daughter's personal space and started shouting at her.
   I said: 'Stop, please don't speak to her like that.' I also raised my
   hand out to say stop," she said.

   "It was very upsetting to see how upset my daughter was, she didn't
   have to witness that.

   "I didn't feel safe walking in there yesterday.

   "As we walked out, we had one woman screaming at us: 'Shame on you -
   you're killing your daughter'."

   Ms Ringham also said a nurse inside the vaccination centre told her
   "many were too scared to walk into the building".

   Cardiff and Vale health board has be asked to comment.

   On Sunday, South Wales Police confirmed a 61-year-old man from Newport
   was arrested, and released on bail, for racially aggravated offences.

   The vaccine has been offered to 12 to 15 year olds in Wales since 4
   October.
