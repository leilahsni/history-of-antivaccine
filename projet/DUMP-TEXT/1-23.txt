   California's Democrat Governor, Gavin Newsom, appears to have got
   enough votes to defeat a move to replace him as leader of the state.

   His handling of the pandemic had been criticised, which fuelled a long
   Republican-led effort to remove him as governor.

   BBC News looks at some of the claims that were made by Governor Newsom
   and his challengers during the campaign.

Gavin Newsom: 'We have among the lowest positivity rates in America... We
have one of the lowest case rates.'

   Governor Newsom was comparing California's Covid record with those of
   states with Republican governors.

   In contrast to California, he said in late August, Texas, Florida and
   Mississippi had some of the country's highest case and test-positivity
   rates in the US.

   The positivity rate shows the proportion of Covid tests that come back
   positive.

   In California, the latest seven-day average proportion of Covid tests
   that came back positive is 2.9% - the third lowest reported of all US
   states, according to Johns Hopkins University.

   Covid restrictions

   Meanwhile, Texas and Mississippi have test-positivity rates of 15-20%
   and Florida 10-15%, the latest data from the US Centers for Disease
   Control shows.

   Over the course of the pandemic, California has recorded more Covid
   cases than any other state.

   But it also has the largest population in the US. And 34 of the 49
   other states, including Florida, Texas and Mississippi, have higher
   per-capita case rates.

   Those with lower rates, however, do include states with Republican
   governors, such as West Virginia and Maryland.

Gavin Newsom: Voting to recall me 'elects an anti-vax Republican'

   On 30 August, Governor Newsom released a campaign advert saying voting
   to recall him would help elect an "anti-vax" Republican governor.

   But all of his Republican challengers have been vaccinated.

   And the leading Republican candidate, Larry Elder, said: "I'm not
   anti-vax.

   "I've been vaccinated because of my age, because of a blood condition I
   have, and my doctor strongly advised me to become vaccinated."

   Mr Elder has said he does not believe children need to be vaccinated.

   And all the Republican challengers have said they would roll back
   vaccine mandates put in place by Governor Newsom for state, school and
   healthcare workers.

Larry Elder: 'We have rising crime'

   Launching his campaign in July, Mr Elder said crime in California was
   rising under Governor Newsom - a claim his challengers have reinforced
   throughout the race.

   Certain crimes have increased significantly since Governor Newsom took
   office, in January 2019. But this is a trend seen in many other parts
   of the country too.

   In 2019, California had its fewest homicides since 1966.

   The following year, the rate rose 31% - while across the country there
   were 25% more murders - although other offences such as property crime
   fell by 7.7%.

   Overall, violent crime - including murder, robbery, aggravated assault
   and rape - rose by 0.8% in California in 2020, compared with 2019.

   But it remains far below its 1990s peak.

   And it rose about 3% across the US as a whole.

   Before the pandemic, California's violent crime rate ranked 12th
   nationwide and was higher than the national average.

Larry Elder: 'People are leaving California for the first time in our state's
170-year history'

   Mr Elder made this claim on 5 September, saying under Governor Newsom,
   for the first time, fewer people were coming to live in California than
   moving away.

   This did happen in 2019 and 2020 under Governor Newsom, according to
   the Public Policy Institute of California, but it was also the case in
   2018 under the previous governor.
   Net migration in California

   More people also left than moved to the state in other periods -
   between 2004 and 2010 and between 1992 and 1996.

   The state's population growth has been slowing for 20 years.

   In 2020, California recorded its first population decline since records
   began, according to state census data, as natural population increase
   didn't outpace people moving out.

   Natural population increase - which represents births minus deaths -
   has been slowing for many years and took a sharp downturn during the
   pandemic.
