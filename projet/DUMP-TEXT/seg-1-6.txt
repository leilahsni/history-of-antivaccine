    MIA has claimed that British Vogue magazine has cancelled a feature 
    about her because of comments she made on vaccination in the 
    coronavirus pandemic  

    Last month  the British  Sri Lankan musician  whose real name is Maya 
    Arulpragasam  said she would  choose death  over a vaccine for the 
    coronavirus  

    On Wednesday  the 44  year  old posted on her Instagram page screenshots 
    of a text conversation with an unidentified person who said that the 
    editor of British Vogue  Edward Enninful  had withdrawn his offer for a 
    feature  She has since removed the post  

    The message quoted a Vogue editor as saying   Considering our August is 
    an issue where we  re chronicling the struggles of the NHS to cope while 
    a vaccine is tried to be made we don  t feel we can have her involved  
    It just wouldn  t be right  All of our issues July  September will be 
    supporting the frontline healthcare workers and we need to be 
    respectful of them and all they are doing until a vaccine exists   

    A spokesperson for British Vogue told the Guardian   British Vogue 
    supports the NHS and everyone on the frontline who are protecting 
    people from the virus and saving lives every day   They offered no 
    comment on MIA  s allegations  

    The Guardian has contacted representatives for MIA  

    Beneath the screenshot on her Instagram account  MIA accused British 
    Vogue of overlooking her activism regarding healthcare  including 
     helping Jeremy Corbyn fight for the NHS  when everyone voted Boris   
    and standing  with Tamils when the Sri Lankan government was bombing UN 
    civilian hospitals  taking financial  career hit   

    She sarcastically thanked the magazine for  acknowledging that choice 
    is a liberty I choose to exercise and fight for  and for  giving me the 
    time to research how many people  s lives have been affected by enforced 
    vaccines across many African countries   

    She went on   Anti vaxer  sic  is your term  It didn  t exist before 
    this binary addiction everyone has to separate everything into this and 
    that  Anti this anti that  I prefer to not make everything so black and 
    white  

     I  m sure there  s  sic  variety of doctors researchers and labs and 
    counties  sic  who understand what  s happening  I  m sure there are good 
    drugs and bad drugs out there  Just doing research isn  t anti anything 
    but pro respecting the process  Btw how many vaccines are you prepared 
    to have  One a year  10 a month  2 a year  Lack of discussion is 
    censorship

    At the end of March  MIA tweeted   All the vaccines you  ve already had 
    is enough to see you through  the coronavirus pandemic   Early in 
    April  she clarified   I  m not against vaccines  I  m against companies 
    who care more for profit then humans  I care for better track record 
    that proves this  I care that African countries are not always the 
    testing ground  I don  t want it coming from banks  tech  hedge fund 
    sector and I want a choice   

    She has also stoked the baseless conspiracy theories linking 5 G to the 
    coronavirus outbreak  While she has said she doesn  t think the two 
    things are related  she has claimed   I think  5 G  can confuse or slow 
    the body down in healing process as body is learning to cope with new 
    singles wavelength s  sic  frequency etc  same time as Cov   

    Members of the public have set fire to 5 G masts around the country  
    despite there being no scientific basis or credible evidence for such 
    claims
