    A woman was injured when trying to remove a similar poster from a 
    crossing in Cardiff 

    London transport staff have been warned after anti  mask posters with 
    razor blades on the back were found  a union has said  

    The Rail  Maritime and Transport  RMT  union said it had raised the 
    issue of  Masks Don  t Work  posters with Transport for London  TfL  

    TfL said it was not aware of any incidents involving blades but had 
    given advice to its workers  

    A similar poster was found in Cardiff where a woman was injured 
    removing it  

    The RMT called for the courts to take the  hardest possible line  
    against those found responsible  
       The human cost of virus misinformation 
       We showed volunteers an anti  vax video  How did they react  

    The RMT has formally raised the issue with TfL and said warning 
    bulletins highlighting the danger of injury had been issued to staff  

    General secretary Mick Lynch said   Any anti  vax conspiracy theorist 
    resorting to this disgusting practice of lacing their propaganda with 
    razor blades needs to know that they will face criminal prosecution and 
    the highest possible sentences  

     As far as RMT is concerned they should be locked up for a long time  
    We would expect the police and the courts to take the hardest possible 
    line

    TfL has sent guidance to staff after the incident in Cardiff 

    TfL said it was not aware of any incidents involving razor blades 
    taking place on its network  

    A spokesperson said   We act urgently to remove unauthorised materials 
    from our network  such as posters  including those relating to the 
    pandemic  

     The safety of our customers and colleagues is paramount and we have 
    issued guidance to our staff on how to remove them safely after reports 
    of instances outside of our network of razor blades being attached to 
    the back of such materials  

     None have been detected on our network and there have been very few 
    instances of unauthorised adverts and materials relating to the 
    pandemic
