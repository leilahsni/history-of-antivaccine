Political correctness is hurting the fight against anti-vaxxers

   We're afraid to tackle conspiracy theories among ethnic minorities

   Pravina Rudra 16 January 2021 • 7:00am Pravina Rudra

   Coronavirus Article Bar with counter ..

   We know that there are gaps in vaccine take-up, but public health
   officials can be curiously vague about why and among whom. And we have
   turned a blind eye to one group in particular where there is
   significant anti-vaxx sentiment: my own community of South Asians.

   Surgeries around the country have reported South Asian patients
   refusing the jab. A recent poll by the Royal Society of Public Health
   found that only 57 per cent of ethnic minority people would be happy to
   have the vaccine, compared with 79 per cent of white people. Yesterday,
   Dr Harpreet Sood, from NHS England, said that the spread of false
   information in the community was part of the problem.

   I’m unsurprised, given the messages relatives have shown me about
   vaccines. Some suggest that the jabs contain beef and alcohol (as
   though Yorkshire grass-fed and Merlot would have been the first
   ingredients AstraZeneca reached for). Others argue that drinking hot
   water can somehow cure Covid.

   Many an anti-vax swami preys on the sentiment beloved of some South
   Asians that our mother’s spice cupboard can cure a range of ills, but
   take it to the same extreme as Islington organic food-eating
   anti-vaxxers, who “just don’t want anything unnatural” in their
   temple-cum-body.

   Other messages feature bog-standard conspiracy theories about vaccines
   altering human DNA – messages that would send many liberals raging if
   they were raised by a white person. But those same people are rendered
   speechless when it comes to anti-vax disinformation among South Asians
   because of political correctness.

   As with everything from caste discrimination to sexism, many are happy
   to drop their most fundamental principles when it comes to ethnic
   minorities, and treat them as a “special case”. They sigh phrases such
   as “language difficulties” and “cultural barriers” and turn their backs
   – as if BAME people were wackos on an unreachable isle, beyond
   salvation.

   Yet this is wrong – and to be honest, comes across as more racist. Many
   mosque leaders as well as other religious figures and Asian doctors are
   working round the clock to correct anti-vax sentiment in their
   communities. But no one else wants to wade into the debate – for fear
   of being dirtied by accusations of racism.

   The irony is that hesitancy around calling out anti-vax sentiment is
   not as generous-spirited as it seems; it will only harm already-at-risk
   South Asians living in tight-knit communities everywhere from Leicester
   to Hounslow, who will not escape Covid as soon as the rest of us if
   they are unwilling to have the vaccine.

   If this year of anxious calibration around R rates and logarithmic
   scales has taught us anything, it is that every person counts. A 0.1
   difference in the R rate can make or break our response to Covid,
   sending the pandemic soaring rather than shrivelling away.

   We can’t let misguided sensitivities stop us from saving lives.
