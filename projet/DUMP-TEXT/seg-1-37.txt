 The race for a Covid vaccine is on  but the  anti  vax  background noise is only 
                                  getting louder 

    As a volunteer on the Oxford trials suffers an  unexplained illness  
    why are more people turning against vaccines

    I was in a taxi the other day  and conversation turned  as it 
    invariably does  to the Covid pandemic  Muffled by a mask in the 
    backseat  I mentioned how much better things would be when we had 
    access to a vaccine  My driver eyed me in the mirror   Vaccine   He 
    said to me   I  m not having one of those  Nor are my kids   

    My heart sank  I asked my driver why not   I don  t know   he said  
     It  s not safe   I told him that clinical trials were currently being 
    performed by the best minds on the planet  He was not impressed   Maybe 
    in a few years  But for now  none of my friends are having it  and nor 
    am I   Pleas about herd immunity  or perhaps even saving the lives of 
    his elderly parents  fell on deaf ears  

    Sadly  my driver is not unique in his views  According to a poll of 
    5000 people last month by childcarecouk  almost half of all parents 
    insisted they would not vaccinate their child if and when a vaccine 
    became available  Eighty  six per cent of these  anti  vaxxers  said the 
    vaccine would be unsafe with  nasty  side  effects  a fifth thought 
    Covid  19  doesn  t really exist   

    It seems their case was boosted when the leading Oxford  AstraZenica 
    vaccine trial was halted on Wednesday after a volunteer suffered an 
     unexplained illness   A spokesman said this was a  routine action  
    that would be investigated in an independent review to maintain the 
    integrity of the work  The trial has now resumed  

    The anti  vax statistics are pretty troubling  even hypothetically  But 
    the problem is that soon  they may not just be theory  Last Monday  
    Matt Hancock raised hopes that a Coronavirus vaccine was  likely to 
    come  in the first few months of 2021  He revealed that the UK was 
    making 30 million doses of vaccine  enough to innoculate half the 
    population   They are starting to manufacture those doses already  
    ahead of approval  so that should approval come through  and it  s 
    still not certain but it is looking up  then we are ready to roll 
    out   he said

    The front runner appeared to be a drug known as AZD 1222  which was 
    created by Oxford University and owned by drug giant AstraZeneca  There 
    are also others in the ring  

    Chris Smith is a consultant medical virologist at the University of 
    Cambridge  He says there are more than 170 projects worldwide  looking 
    into 10 different types of vaccines   The government has backed 
    multiple horses  but one of the leading contenders is the Oxford 
    vaccine  it  s based on a tried and tested Ebola vaccine construct  
    which has already proven itself  so that reduces the uncertainty   says 
    Dr Smith  

    The problem is that creating a vaccine is a tricky area   We are 
    rushing out in a year something that normally takes ten   says Dr 
    Smith   So for a vaccine to be a  game  changer   there have to be an 
    enormous amount of assumptions  Firstly that it  s going to work to 
    produce an immune response  Secondly  that that immune response is 
    sufficient to protect people  And third  that the vaccine is safe  
    meaning that it does not produce adverse reactions or severe 
    side  effects out of keeping for what you would expect for a vaccine of 
    this type   You also have to be able to make enough of it  says Dr 
    Smith

     If it  s the case that a Covid vaccine turns out as effective as  say  
    the polio vaccine  and it  s a big  if   then we have a chance to go 
    back to business as usual   he says   But so far  no information on the 
    effectiveness of the vaccine at preventing infection in humans has yet 
    been made public   

    While the world strains to find a manufactured solution to  beat  the 
    virus  there is the background noise of the  anti  vaxxers   These are 
    the people who are against inoculations  and are particularly against 
    vaccinating their own children  who think vaccines cause autism  that 
    politicians are scare  mongering about the disease to drum up profits 
    for drug companies  and that Bill Gates will be using injections to 
    plant microchips into their children  Piers Corbyn  brother of Jeremy  
    and Novak Djokovic are famous anti  vaxxers

    This movement started with gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield  the 
    lead author of a 1998 Lancet study purporting to show a link between 
    the MMR  Mumps  Measles and Rubella  jab and developmental disorders  
    The piece was later retracted after an investigation found a conflict 
    of interest  that Wakefield had been funded by a group of people who 
    were suing vaccine producers  Wakefield was discredited and struck off 
    the medical register in 2010  yet it took nearly two decades for the UK 
    immunisation rates to recover  By the late 2010 s  UK families had 
    experienced more than 12000 cases of measles  hundreds of 
    hospitalisations — many with serious complications — and at least three 
    deaths  

    Despite their denunciation  Wakefield  s  findings  gave birth to the 
     anti  vax  movement  The Centre for Countering Digital Hate calculates 
    that 58 million people follow conspiracy  theory accounts on social 
    media  

    The World Health Organisation cares so much about the anti  vaxxers that 
    it has published a 44  page document for medical professionals called 
     How To Respond to Vocal Vaccine Deniers in Public   It makes a 
    distinction between  vaccine refusers  and  vaccine deniers   The 
    former  refuse vaccinations without doubting the wisdom of this 
    decision  But this refusal still permits the refuser to consider other 
    opinions and arguments   

    The vaccine deniers  on the other hand   are members of a subgroup who 
    have a very negative attitude towards vaccination and are not open to a 
    change of mind  no matter what the evidence says   

    And the problem is that the deniers feed the anxiety of the refusers  

     Regrettably  the echo chamber of social media  where members of these 
    groups find sympathetic like  minded ears  pours oil on the deniers and 
    refuseniks  fires   says Dr Smith   This leads them to believe they 
    must have a point  because hundreds of people  who don  t know any 
    better   like  the garbage they are spouting  The anti  vaxxers are 
    certainly part of the problem   

    Paul Hunter  professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia  
    goes further  He calls the anti  vax movement  depressing  and 
     selfish    As a doctor I have known children die who would have 
    survived if they had been vaccinated  The risks of vaccines have been 
    maliciously overestimated  

    Let  s consider for a moment that the anti  vaxxers have a case  The 
    American vaccination programme is rather impressively  some would say 
    unnecessarily  called Operation Warp Speed  But there is a limit to how 
    quickly a vaccine can safely be introduced   Vaccines not only need to 
    be safe   says Chris Smith   They have to be proven to be safe  and 
    statistically robust   America suffered a lesson in 1976 when a 
    rushed  out vaccine in response to a serious flu virus led to the deaths 
    of three patients in a New Jersey nursing home  the day they had been 
    vaccinated  A media frenzy ensued  

    Jim Buttery is a Professor of Paediatric Immunology at Monash 
    University in Australia   In the course of this pandemic  we  ve often 
    heard that fast can  t be safe in the context of a vaccine  We don  t 
    feel that  s the case here   

    The reason these trials are moving so fast  he says  is largely because 
    recruitment is happening so quickly  The phase three trials of the 
    Oxford vaccine will have 4000050  000 participants in total   Beyond 
    this vaccine  we  re seeing open disclosure of processes and 
    transparency around any issues   says Professor Buttery   This includes 
    a pledge from the major pharmaceutical companies to keep safety at the 
    forefront when evaluating COVID  19 vaccines   

    And side  effects   All drugs have side  effects   says Chris Smith  
     Scientists need to work out who gets them  and why  We have to decide 
    what level of risk we are willing to carry   Says Professor Paul 
    Hunter   The risks of vaccines have been maliciously overestimated   

    Ultimately  says Chris Smith  it  s about risk   Covid is not going to 
    go away  So much is unknown about it  But we do know that it  s not an 
    equal opportunities virus  Men are more likely to get severe disease  
    as are older people  because of their physiology and biochemistry   The 
    question  then  he says  is how we can best make efforts to protect 
    this section of the population while allowing as much normality as 
    possible in the others  

     We may have to accept uncertainty and take what is offered   says Dr 
    Smith   Maybe a vaccine will not be a panacea  but it might turn what 
    would be a lethal infection for some into a non  lethal infection  
    Grandma might catch it from the youngsters  and she will just have a 
    cold   

    On the anti  vaxxers  Dr Smith has this to say   if these people will 
    take a gamble with their kids getting a potentially lethal disease like 
    measles  why on earth will they give two hoots about Grandma

    the risks
